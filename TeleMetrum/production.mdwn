# TeleMetrum Units

This page contains Bdale's notes about each unit of [TeleMetrum](..) 
assembled to date.

## sn 1 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 to be SPI memory 
chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 56k, 10k tacked from each to 
ground.  R17 replaced with short circuit, R18 removed.

Installed in Bdale's Vertical Assault.  First unit to be flown on 
19 April 2009, on a Cesaroni J335.

Successfully flew Bdale's rebuilt Horizon dual-deploy at Hudson Ranch on
2009.07.18 with a MAWD as backup.  The first dual-deploy flight with a TM
board in control of ejection charges!

## sn 2 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 to be SPI memory 
chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 56k, 10k tacked from each to 
ground.

Delivered to Keith Packard for firmware development and use.  Flown twice
on 10 May 2008 in Keith's Grappler to about 45m on Estes D12-3 motors.

Flew in Keith's Little Dog Dual Deploy at Mile High Mayhem as a payload.  The
ascent was pretty but the rocket failed to deploy and lawn-darted.  The battery
and screw terminal block connectors got more or less torn off, but the rest
of the board survived and good data was recovered from the flight.

Repaired by Bdale, sent back to Keith on 7 July 2009.  Keith reports the
baro sensor (which is still original) is flakey and needs to be replaced.

## sn 3 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.04.22, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 
to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.

Installed in Bdale's Vertical Assault after sn 1 moved to Horizon, but never
flown there.

Pulled and given to Keith to take home from Mayhem.

Lost in Keith's Nike which was never found after an apparently nominal flight 
in June 2009 at Brothers, Oregon.

## sn 4 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.04.22, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 
to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.

Installed in Robert's Lil Nuke.

Lost at Hudson Ranch 2009.07.18 when we forgot to tape the nose cone on and
both it and the electronics sled came out at apogee and were not recovered.

## sn 5 ##

Partial "ground" load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.04.23 plus beeper and serial 
connector for use as TeleDongle or for TeleTerra prototype.

Bdale's TeleDongle.

Keith added acrylic LED light pipes and a LiPo for use in RDF after flight.

## sn 7 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.08.08, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 
to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.

Pulled from Vertical Assault (never flew there) and taken to Keith in Japan
in October 2009 as replacement.

## sn 8 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.08.08, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 
to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.

Delivered to Keith in early November 2009.

## sn 9 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.08.15, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 
to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.

Installed in Bdale's Trick-o-Treat 98mm airframe.

## sn 10 ##

to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.  Accelerometer loaded is MMA2204EG 100G unit!

In G-Spot, this accelerometer recorded 52.8 gee acceleration on a
Cesaroni pro29 H399 reload at NCR Oktoberfest 2009!

## sn 12 ##
