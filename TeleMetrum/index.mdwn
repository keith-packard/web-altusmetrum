# TeleMetrum

This is a recording dual-deploy altimeter for high power model rocketry 
with integrated GPS and telemetry link.  

For the latest TeleMetrum firmware and related ground station software, please
visit the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.

These are photos of the previous production version (we haven't taken good
pictures of v1.2 yet):

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for TeleMetrum and all other Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telemetrum](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telemetrum;a=summary).  

Work on the next version proceeds on the master branch, with occasional
temporary branches created when Bdale is making some major / speculative
change.  Branched with names like 'v1.2' document what we're actually flying 
on the respective PCB revisions.  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
of the files for Production PCB version 1.2 in more easily readable form.

Rockets we know of flying with TeleMetrum boards have exceeded 50g acceleration, 
been well above Mach 1, and reached altitudes 
greater than 25k feet AGL with great results.  Keith's second generation 
ground station program called AltosUI works on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems
and logs telemetry to disk, displays current and max values for key parameters 
during flight, includes voice synthesis during the flight so that 
our eyes can stay on the rockets, and even includes live display of rocket
position over moving maps!  After flight, altosui can extract the 
complete flight log from TeleMetrum, can display plots of the data from either
the telemetry received by radio or the onboard flight log, can output a kml 
file for use with [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com), and can also 
output all the flight data as a csv file for easy import to spreadsheet 
programs or other analysis tools allowing you to perform whatever
custom analysis you can envision!  More details on the software, 
including full source code and pre-built packages
can be found on the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.  Feel free to 
download the software and try it before purchasing our hardware!

## Future Plans ##

TeleMetrum v1.2 is now available for sale.  Eventually we'll run out of v1.2
boards, and by then no dobut we'll have found more things to tweak...
