# TeleMetrum

This is a recording dual-deploy altimeter for high power model rocketry 
with integrated telemetry link.

## Motivation ##

Bdale and Keith both own 
[BeeLine](http://www.bigredbee.com/BeeLine.htm)
trackers from 
[Big Red Bee](http://www.bigredbee.com), and are pretty happy with them.
They use a PIC processor and a TI CC1050 transmitter chip, and
operate in the ham radio 70cm band.

One weekend while attending a conference together, we got to wondering if 
we couldn't adapt one to use as a downlink for the
[AltusMetrum](../AltusMetrum/) altimeter board in addition to direction
finding after flight.  That caused us to start thinking about other things
in the design we might want to tweak, and before long we were working on the
design of a new tracker board derived from the BeeLine design.
Another friend at the same conference showed us a board he was working on 
using a different part in the same TI series, that integrated a transceiver
and CPU on the same chip.
It didn't take us long to realize that with such a part we could combine and
simplify things by building a new altimeter with integrated RF link!

## Problems ##

* The CC1111F32 is a 36-pin QFN package, which necessitates reflow soldering.

* Since we needed to reflow solder anyway, and because TI used them in their
  reference design, we went a little crazy and used 0402 passive parts 
  everywhere.  That means working under a microscope to place parts!

## Artifacts ##

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com).

As of 6 March 2009, the first two boards are loaded, and we're about to start
turning them on and testing things!
