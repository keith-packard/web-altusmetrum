Compared with the v1 series, v2 includes a better GPS (uBlox vs
Skytraq), higher power radio (40mW instead of 10mW), wider range and
more precise pressure sensor (100k' MSL vs 45k' MSL), larger on-board
storage (8MB vs 2MB), more precise, wider range accelerometer (12 bits instead of
10 bits, 105g instead of 70g) and faster processor (32-bit ARM instead
of 8-bit 8051).

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for TeleMetrum and all other Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telemetrum](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telemetrum;a=summary).  

Work on the next version proceeds on the master branch, with occasional
temporary branches created when Bdale is making some major / speculative
change.  Branched with names like 'v2.0' document what we're actually flying 
on the respective PCB revisions.  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
of the files for Production PCB version 2.0 in more easily readable form.

Rockets we know of flying with TeleMetrum boards have exceeded 50g acceleration, 
been well above Mach 1, and reached altitudes 
greater than 25k feet AGL with great results.  Keith's second generation 
ground station program called AltosUI works on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems
and logs telemetry to disk, displays current and max values for key parameters 
during flight, includes voice synthesis during the flight so that 
our eyes can stay on the rockets, and even includes live display of rocket
position over moving maps!  After flight, altosui can extract the 
complete flight log from TeleMetrum, can display plots of the data from either
the telemetry received by radio or the onboard flight log, can output a kml 
file for use with [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com), and can also 
output all the flight data as a csv file for easy import to spreadsheet 
programs or other analysis tools allowing you to perform whatever
custom analysis you can envision!  More details on the software, 
including full source code and pre-built packages
can be found on the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.  Feel free to 
download the software and try it before purchasing our hardware!

## Future Plans ##

Prototypes of v2.0 were flown at Airfest 2013 and everything worked
great, except that we're not satisfied with the performance of the GPS
antenna chosen.  We hope to resolve that issue soon and should have
TeleMetrum v2.0 boards for sale shortly.
