A quick update as of 25 December 2008.  
The circuit board artwork is out for fab!

A quick update as of 16 December 2008.  
The ARM7-based 'AltusMetrum' design has been shelved indefinitely.
Working with Keith Packard, I recently embarked on a complete redesign based on the TI cc1111.
We got there by deciding we need a low-power RF beacon for post-landing direction finding, learning
of the existence of this part, then realizing that we could radically simplify things by using it
as the basis for a completely new avionics design.
The cc1111 integrates a full 70cm transceiver, 8051 processing core, and peripherals on one chip.
We add to that a barometric sensor, temperature sensor, accelerometer, eeprom memory, and full LiPo
battery support powered by a USB interface also used for configuration and post-flight data extraction.
It looks like we can get all the features we want on a single board for less than the price of most
commercial altimeter boards, with the only downside being dramatically reduced processing power.
We have a complete schematic and a first pass PCB layout that is currently
under review and improvement prior to sending out for raw boards.

See the hw/telemetrum tree in our
<a href="http://git.gag.com">public git repository</a> 
for the current state of the gEDA design files.

We hope to be turning on boards and writing firmware over the 
Christmas / New Years holiday season.
Stay tuned!
