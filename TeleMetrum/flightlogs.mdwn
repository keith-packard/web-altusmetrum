Flew sn 1 in Vertical Assault on J335 at Tripoli Colorado launch site near
Hartsel, Colorado.  Good flight data collected through apogee.  Data record
ends apparently coincident with firing of apogee charge by adjacent MAWD.
One mounting screw found missing later (the one that goes between the screw
terminals and the LiPo battery connector), so it's entirely possible the power
was short-circuited briefly when the screw worked loose.
