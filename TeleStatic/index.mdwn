# TeleStatic â€” Wireless Rocket Motor Static Test System #

<img src="protos/telestatic.jpg">

TeleStatic is a secure radio-controlled system capable of operating 
a rocket motor static test stand.

TeleStatic uses a two-way digital radio communications system for
positive indication of all operations. The communications link is
secured with AES CBC-MAC to prevent accidental or intentional
operation from unauthorized transmitters.

TeleStatic operates in the 70cm amateur band at low power using 
Altus Metrum's proven modulation and coding schem to avoid interference 
with any rocketry electronics or other communication devices.

The TeleStatic board is easily configured using USB for
parameters like operating frequency, callsign, cryptographic key, and
the designated bank number.

A TeleStatic board can also be used as a one-channel pyro board in the
larger [TeleLaunch](../TeleLaunch) system when needed.

TeleStatic is an alternate load of the TeleFireOne board, whose hardware
design is available from [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telelco](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telefireone;a=summary).  

## Documentation ##

Not written yet.

## Software ##

TeleLaunch firmware is part of the larger [AltOS](/AltOS) suite of 
software.  A separate TeleStatic application for use on a laptop at the
control operator's position is currently under development.

## Availability ##

A prototype system was operated extensively during the 2017, and based
on that experience a revised version of the circuit board was designed
and will be tested in the first half of 2018.  General availability of
the TeleStatic product is expected in mid 2018.  Watch
this space for updates on price and availability.
