# TeleStatic â€” Wireless Rocket Motor Static Test System #

<img src="protos/telestatic.jpg">

TeleStatic is a secure radio-controlled system capable of operating 
a rocket motor static test stand.  Sensors supported by the base
configuration include one pressure sensor for chamber pressure,
and one load cell for thrust measurement.

TeleStatic uses a two-way digital radio communications system for
positive indication of all operations. The communications link is
secured with AES CBC-MAC to prevent accidental or intentional
operation from unauthorized transmitters.

TeleStatic operates in the 70cm amateur band at low power using 
Altus Metrum's proven modulation and coding schem to avoid interference 
with any rocketry electronics or other communication devices.

The TeleStatic board is easily configured using USB for
parameters like operating frequency, callsign, cryptographic key, and
the designated bank number.

A TeleStatic board can also be used as a one-channel pyro board in the
larger [TeleLaunch](../TeleLaunch) system when needed.

TeleStatic began as an alternate load of the TeleFireOne board, whose 
hardware design is available from [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) 
in the project 
[hw/telefireone](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telefireone;a=summary).  

## Documentation ##

Not written yet.

## Software ##

TeleStatic firmware is part of the larger [AltOS](/AltOS) suite of 
software.  A separate TeleStatic application for use on a laptop at the
control operator's position is currently under development and will also
be part of the AltOS suite.

## Availability ##

A prototype system was developed in 2017, and has been in routine use
ever since.  The electronics has been through at least three major 
revisions, none of which have yet made it into production.  A "final"
version is being worked on based on everything learned so far, and
we hope to have it for sale by the end of calendar 2020.  Watch this 
space for updates.
