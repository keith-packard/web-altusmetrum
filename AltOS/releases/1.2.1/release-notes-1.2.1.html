    Version 1.2.1 is a minor release. It adds support for TeleBT and
    the AltosDroid application, provides several new features in
    AltosUI and fixes some bugs in the AltOS firmware.

    AltOS Firmware Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
	Add support for TeleBT
      </li><li class="listitem">
	In TeleMini recovery mode (when booted with the outer two
	debug pins connected together), the radio parameters are also
	set back to defaults (434.550MHz, N0CALL, factory radio cal).
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Add support for reflashing the SkyTraq GPS chips. This
	requires special host-side code which currently only exists
	for Linux.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Correct Kalman filter model error covariance matrix. The
	values used previously assumed continuous measurements instead
	of discrete measurements.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Fix some bugs in the USB driver for TeleMetrum and TeleDongle
	that affected Windows users.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Adjusted the automatic gain control parameters that affect
	receive performance for TeleDongle. Field tests indicate that this
	may improve receive performance somewhat.
      </li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    AltosUI Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
	Handle missing GPS lock in 'Descent' tab. Previously, if the
	GPS position of the pad was unknown, an exception would be
	raised, breaking the Descent tab contents.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Improve the graph, adding tool-tips to show values near the
	cursor and making the displayed set of values configurable,
	adding all of the flight data as options while leaving the
	default settings alone so that the graph starts by showing
	height, speed and acceleration.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Make the initial position of the AltosUI top level window
	configurable. Along with this change, the other windows will
	pop up at 'sensible' places now, instead of on top of one
	another.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Add callsign to Monitor idle window and connecting
	dialogs. This makes it clear which callsign is being used so
	that the operator will be aware that it must match the flight
	computer value or no communication will work.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	When downloading flight data, display the block number so that
	the user has some sense of progress. Unfortunately, we don't
	know how many blocks will need to be downloaded, but at least
	it isn't just sitting there doing nothing for a long time.
      </li><li class="listitem">
	Add GPS data and a map to the graph window. This lets you see
	a complete summary of the flight without needing to 'replay'
	the whole thing.
      </li></ul></div><p>
