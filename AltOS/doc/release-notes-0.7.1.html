Version 0.7.1 is the first release containing our new cross-platform Java-based user interface. AltosUI can:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
      Receive and log telemetry from a connected TeleDongle
      device. All data received is saved to log files named with the
      current date and the connected rocket serial and flight
      numbers. There is no mode in which telemetry data will not be
      saved.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Download logged data from TeleMetrum devices, either through a
      direct USB connection or over the air through a TeleDongle
      device.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Configure a TeleMetrum device, setting the radio channel,
      callsign, apogee delay and main deploy height. This can be done
      through either a USB connection or over a radio link via a
      TeleDongle device.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Replay a flight in real-time. This takes a saved telemetry log
      or eeprom download and replays it through the user interface so
      you can relive your favorite rocket flights.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Reprogram Altus Metrum devices. Using an Altus Metrum device
      connected via USB, another Altus Metrum device can be
      reprogrammed using the supplied programming cable between the
      two devices.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Export Flight data to a comma-separated-values file. This takes
      either telemetry or on-board flight data and generates data
      suitable for use in external applications. All data is exported
      using standard units so that no device-specific knowledge is
      needed to handle the data.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Speak to you during the flight. Instead of spending the flight
      hunched over your laptop looking at the screen, enjoy the view
      while the computer tells you what&#8217;s going on up there. During
      ascent, you hear the current flight state and altitude
      information. During descent, you get azimuth, elevation and
      range information to try and help you find your rocket in the
      air. Once on the ground, the direction and distance are
      reported.
