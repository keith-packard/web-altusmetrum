Post-flight graphing tool. This lets you explore the
behaviour of your rocket after flight with a scroll-able and
zoom-able chart showing the altitude, speed and acceleration
of the airframe along with events recorded by the flight
computer. You can export graphs to PNG files, or print them
directly.
</li><li class="listitem">
Real-time moving map which overlays the in-progress flight
on satellite imagery fetched from Google Maps. This lets you
see in pictures where your rocket has landed, allowing you
to plan recovery activities more accurately.
</li><li class="listitem">
Wireless recovery system testing. Prep your rocket for
flight and test fire the deployment charges to make sure
things work as expected. All without threading wires through
holes in your airframe.
</li><li class="listitem">
Optimized flight status displays. Each flight state now has
it’s own custom <span class="emphasis"><em>tab</em></span> in the flight monitoring window so you
can focus on the most important details. Pre-flight, the
system shows a set of red/green status indicators for
battery voltage, apogee/main igniter continutity and GPS
reception. Wait until they’re all green and your rocket is
ready for flight. There are also tabs for ascent, descent
and landing along with the original tabular view of the
data.
</li><li class="listitem">
Monitor multiple flights simultaneously. If you have more
than one TeleDongle, you can monitor a flight with each one
on the same computer.
</li><li class="listitem">
Automatic flight monitoring at startup. Plug TeleDongle into
the machine before starting AltosUI and it will
automatically connect to it and prepare to monitor a flight.
</li><li class="listitem">
Exports Google Earth flight tracks. Using the Keyhole Markup
Language (.kml) file format, this provides a 3D view of your
rocket flight through the Google Earth program.
