<dt class="hdlist1">Install MicroPeak in your rocket</dt>
<dd>
<p>This can be as simple as preparing a soft cushion of wadding
inside a vented model payload bay. Wherever you mount it,
make sure you protect the barometric sensor from corrosive
ejection gasses as those will damage the sensor, and shield
it from light as that can cause incorrect sensor readings.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Turn MicroPeak on</dt>
<dd>
<p>Slide the switch so that the actuator covers the '1' printed
on the board. MicroPeak will report the maximum height of
the last flight in decimeters using a sequence of flashes on
the LED. A sequence of short flashes indicates one digit. A
single long flash indicates zero. The height is reported in
decimeters, so the last digit will be tenths of a meter. For
example, if MicroPeak reports 5 4 4 3, then the maximum
height of the last flight was 544.3m, or 1786 feet.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Finish preparing the rocket for flight</dt>
<dd>
<p>After the previous flight data have been reported, MicroPeak
waits for one minute before starting to check for
launch. This gives you time to finish assembling the
rocket. As those activities might cause pressure changes
inside the airframe, MicroPeak might accidentally detect
boost. If you need to do anything to the airframe after the
one minute window passes, make sure to be careful not to
disturb the altimeter. The LED will remain dark during the
one minute delay, but after that, it will start blinking
once every 3 seconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fly the rocket</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once the rocket passes about 30m in height (100 feet), the
micro-controller will record the ground pressure and track
the pressure seen during the flight. In this mode, the LED
flickers rapidly. When the rocket lands, and the pressure
stabilizes, the micro-controller will record the minimum
pressure pressure experienced during the flight, compute the
height represented by the difference in air pressure and
blink that value out on the LED. After that, MicroPeak
powers down to conserve battery power.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Recover the data</dt>
<dd>
<p>Turn MicroPeak off and then back on. MicroPeak will blink
out the maximum height for the last flight. Turn MicroPeak
back off to conserve battery power.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak collects raw barometric pressure data which
is then used to compute the remaining data. Altitude
is computed through a standard atmospheric
model. Absolute error in this data will be affected by
local atmospheric conditions. Fortunately, these
errors tend to mostly cancel out, so the error in the
height computation is much smaller than the error in
altitude would be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Speed and acceleration are computed by first smoothing
the height data with a Gaussian window averaging
filter. For speed data, this average uses seven
samples. For acceleration data, eleven samples are
used. These were chosen to provide reasonably smooth
speed and acceleration data, which would otherwise be
swamped with noise.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Altus Metrum products are sophisticated electronic
devices.  When handled gently and properly installed in an
air-frame, they will deliver impressive results.  However, as
with all electronic devices, there are some precautions you
must take.</p>

<td class="content">
The CR1025 Lithium batteries have an extraordinary power
density.  This is great because we can fly with much less
battery mass&#8230;&#8203; but if they are punctured or their contacts
are allowed to short, they can and will release their energy
very rapidly!  Thus we recommend that you take some care when
handling MicroPeak to keep conductive material from coming in
contact with the exposed metal elements.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The barometric sensor used in MicroPeak is sensitive to
sunlight. Please consider this when designing an
installation. Many model rockets with payload bays use clear
plastic for the payload bay. Replacing these with an opaque
cardboard tube, painting them, or wrapping them with a layer
of masking tape are all reasonable approaches to keep the
sensor out of direct sunlight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The barometric sensor sampling ports must be able to
"breathe", both by not being covered by foam or tape or other
materials that might directly block the hole on the top of the
sensor, and also by having a suitable static vent to outside
air.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with all other rocketry electronics, Altus Metrum
altimeters must be protected from exposure to corrosive motor
exhaust and ejection charge gasses.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_technical_information">Appendix B: Technical Information</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_barometric_sensor">B.1. Barometric Sensor</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak uses the Measurement Specialties MS5607
sensor. This has a range of 120kPa to 1kPa with an
absolute accuracy of 150Pa and a resolution of 2.4Pa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pressure range corresponds roughly to an altitude
range of -1500m (-4900 feet) to 31000m (102000 feet),
while the resolution is approximately 20cm (8 inches)
near sea level and 60cm (24in) at 10000m (33000 feet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ground pressure is computed from an average of 16
samples, taken while the altimeter is at rest. The
flight pressure used to report maximum height is
computed from a Kalman filter designed to smooth out
any minor noise in the sensor values. The flight
pressure recorded to non-volatile storage is
unfiltered, coming directly from the pressure sensor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_micro_controller">B.2. Micro-controller</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak uses an Atmel ATtiny85
micro-controller. This tiny CPU contains 8kB of flash
for the application, 512B of RAM for temporary data
storage and 512B of EEPROM for non-volatile storage of
previous flight data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ATtiny85 has a low-power mode which turns off all
of the clocks and powers down most of the internal
components. In this mode, the chip consumes only .1Î¼A
of power. MicroPeak uses this mode once the flight has
ended to preserve battery power.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lithium_battery">B.3. Lithium Battery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CR1025 battery used by MicroPeak holds 30mAh of
power, which is sufficient to run for over 40
hours. Because MicroPeak powers down on landing, run
time includes only time sitting on the launch pad or
during flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The large positive terminal (+) is usually marked,
while the smaller negative terminal is not. Make sure
you install the battery with the positive terminal
facing away from the circuit board where it will be in
contact with the metal battery holder. A small pad on
the circuit board makes contact with the negative
battery terminal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shipping restrictions may prevent us from including a
CR1025 battery with MicroPeak. If so, many stores
carry CR1025 batteries as they are commonly used in
small electronic devices such as flash lights.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_atmospheric_model">B.4. Atmospheric Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak contains a fixed atmospheric model which is
used to convert barometric pressure into altitude. The
model was converted into a 469-element piece-wise
linear approximation which is then used to compute the
altitude of the ground and apogee. The difference
between these represents the maximum height of the
flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model assumes a particular set of atmospheric
conditions, which, while a reasonable average, cannot
represent the changing nature of the real
atmosphere. Fortunately, for flights reasonably close
to the ground, the effect of this global inaccuracy
are largely canceled out when the computed ground
altitude is subtracted from the computed apogee
altitude, so the resulting height is more accurate
than either the ground or apogee altitudes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the raw pressure data is recorded to
non-volatile storage, you can use that, along with a
more sophisticated atmospheric model, to compute your
own altitude values.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mechanical_considerations">B.5. Mechanical Considerations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak is designed to be rugged enough for typical
rocketry applications. It contains two moving parts,
the battery holder and the power switch, which were
selected for their ruggedness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The MicroPeak battery holder is designed to withstand
impact up to 150g without breaking contact (or, worse
yet, causing the battery to fall out). That means it
should stand up to almost any launch you care to try,
and should withstand fairly rough landings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The power switch is designed to withstand up to 50g
forces in any direction. Because it is a sliding
switch, orienting the switch perpendicular to the
direction of rocket travel will serve to further
protect the switch from launch forces.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_micropeak_programming_interface">B.6. MicroPeak Programming Interface</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak exposes a standard 6-pin AVR programming
interface, but not using the usual 2x3 array of pins
on 0.1" centers. Instead, there is a single row of
tiny 0.60mm Ã 0.85mm pads on 1.20mm centers exposed
near the edge of the circuit board. We couldn&#8217;t find
any connector that was small enough to include on the
circuit board.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In lieu of an actual connector, the easiest way to
connect to the bare pads is through a set of Pogo
pins. These spring-loaded contacts are designed to
connect in precisely this way. We&#8217;ve designed a
programming jig, the MicroPeak Pogo Pin board which
provides a standard AVR interface on one end and a
recessed slot for MicroPeak to align the board with
the Pogo Pins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The MicroPeak Pogo Pin board is not a complete AVR
programmer, it is an interface board that provides a
3.3V regulated power supply to run the MicroPeak via
USB and a standard 6-pin AVR programming interface
with the usual 2x3 grid of pins on 0.1" centers. This
can be connected to any AVR programming dongle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AVR programming interface cannot run faster than Â¼
of the AVR CPU clock frequency. Because MicroPeak runs
at 250kHz to save power, you must configure your AVR
programming system to clock the AVR programming
interface at no faster than 62.5kHz, or a clock period
of 32ÂµS.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_on_board_data_storage">Appendix C: On-board data storage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ATtiny85 has 512 bytes of non-volatile storage, separate
from the code storage memory. The MicroPeak firmware uses this
to store information about the last completed
flight. Barometric measurements from the ground before launch
and at apogee are stored, and used at power-on to compute the
height of the last flight.</p>

<p>In addition to the data used to present the height of the last
flight, MicroPeak also stores barometric information sampled
at regular intervals during the flight. This is the
information captured with the MicroPeak USB adapter. It can
also be read from MicroPeak through any AVR programming tool.</p>

<p>All EEPROM data are stored least-significant byte first. The
instantaneous flight pressure data are stored without the
upper 16 bits of data. The upper bits can be reconstructed
from the previous sample, assuming that pressure doesn&#8217;t
change by more more than 32kPa in a single sample
interval. Note that this pressure data is <strong>not</strong> filtered in
any way, while both the recorded ground and apogee pressure
values are, so you shouldn&#8217;t expect the minimum instantaneous
pressure value to match the recorded minimum pressure value
exactly.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>MicroPeak samples pressure every 96ms, but stores only every
other sample in the EEPROM. This provides for 251 pressure
samples at 192ms intervals, or 48.192s of storage. The clock
used for these samples is a factory calibrated RC circuit
built into the ATtiny85 and is accurate only to within Â±10% at
25Â°C. So, you can count on the pressure data being accurate,
but speed or acceleration data computed from this will be
limited by the accuracy of this clock.</p>
