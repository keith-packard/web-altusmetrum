      Thanks to Bob Finch, W9YA, NAR 12965, TRA 12350 for writing &#8220;The
      Mere-Mortals Quick Start/Usage Guide to the Altus Metrum Starter
      Kit&#8221; which formed the basis of the original Getting Started chapter 
      in this manual.  Bob was one of our first customers for a production
      TeleMetrum, and his continued enthusiasm and contributions
      are immensely gratifying and highly appreciated!
    </p><p>
      And thanks to Anthony (AJ) Towns for major contributions including
      the AltosUI graphing and site map code and associated documentation. 
      Free software means that our customers and friends can become our
      collaborators, and we certainly appreciate this level of
      contribution!
    </p><p>
      Have fun using these products, and we hope to meet all of you
      out on the rocket flight line somewhere.

      Welcome to the Altus Metrum community!  Our circuits and software reflect
      our passion for both hobby rocketry and Free Software.  We hope their
      capabilities and performance will delight you in every way, but by
      releasing all of our hardware and software designs under open licenses,
      we also hope to empower you to take as active a role in our collective
      future as you wish!
    </p><p>
      The first device created for our community was TeleMetrum, a dual
      deploy altimeter with fully integrated GPS and radio telemetry
      as standard features, and a &#8220;companion interface&#8221; that will
      support optional capabilities in the future. The latest version
      of TeleMetrum, v2.0, has all of the same features but with
      improved sensors and radio to offer increased performance.
    </p><p>
      Our second device was TeleMini, a dual deploy altimeter with
      radio telemetry and radio direction finding. The first version
      of this device was only 13mm by 38mm (½ inch by 1½ inches) and
      could fit easily in an 18mm air-frame. The latest version, v2.0,
      includes a beeper, USB data download and extended on-board
      flight logging, along with an improved barometric sensor.
    </p><p>
      TeleMega is our most sophisticated device, including six pyro
      channels (four of which are fully programmable), integrated GPS,
      integrated gyroscopes for staging/air-start inhibit and high
      performance telemetry.
    </p><p>
      EasyMini is a dual-deploy altimeter with logging and built-in
      USB data download.
    </p><p>
      TeleDongle was our first ground station, providing a USB to RF
      interfaces for communicating with the altimeters. Combined with
      your choice of antenna and notebook computer, TeleDongle and our
      associated user interface software form a complete ground
      station capable of logging and displaying in-flight telemetry,
      aiding rocket recovery, then processing and archiving flight
      data for analysis and review.
    </p><p>
      For a slightly more portable ground station experience that also
      provides direct rocket recovery support, TeleBT offers flight
      monitoring and data logging using a  Bluetooth&#8482; connection between
      the receiver and an Android device that has the AltosDroid
      application installed from the Google Play store.
    </p><p>
      More products will be added to the Altus Metrum family over time, and
      we currently envision that this will be a single, comprehensive manual
      for the entire product family.
    </p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="idp47734608"></a>Chapter 2. Getting Started</h1></div></div></div><p>
      The first thing to do after you check the inventory of parts in your
      &#8220;starter kit&#8221; is to charge the battery.
    </p><p>
      For TeleMetrum and TeleMega, the battery can be charged by plugging it into the
      corresponding socket of the device and then using the USB
      cable to plug the flight computer into your computer's USB socket. The
      on-board circuitry will charge the battery whenever it is plugged
      in, because the on-off switch does NOT control the
      charging circuitry.
    </p><p>
      On TeleMetrum v1 boards, when the GPS chip is initially
      searching for satellites, TeleMetrum will consume more current
      than it pulls from the USB port, so the battery must be
      attached in order to get satellite lock.  Once GPS is locked,
      the current consumption goes back down enough to enable charging
      while running. So it's a good idea to fully charge the battery
      as your first item of business so there is no issue getting and
      maintaining satellite lock.  The yellow charge indicator led
      will go out when the battery is nearly full and the charger goes
      to trickle charge. It can take several hours to fully recharge a
      deeply discharged battery.
    </p><p>
      TeleMetrum v2.0 and TeleMega use a higher power battery charger,
      allowing them to charge the battery while running the board at
      maximum power. When the battery is charging, or when the board
      is consuming a lot of power, the red LED will be lit. When the
      battery is fully charged, the green LED will be lit. When the
      battery is damaged or missing, both LEDs will be lit, which
      appears yellow.
    </p><p>
      The Lithium Polymer TeleMini and EasyMini battery can be charged by
      disconnecting it from the board and plugging it into a
      standalone battery charger such as the LipoCharger product
      included in TeleMini Starter Kits, and connecting that via a USB
      cable to a laptop or other USB power source.
    </p><p>
      You can also choose to use another battery with TeleMini v2.0
      and EasyMini, anything supplying between 4 and 12 volts should
      work fine (like a standard 9V battery), but if you are planning
      to fire pyro charges, ground testing is required to verify that
      the battery supplies enough current to fire your chosen e-matches.
    </p><p>
      The other active device in the starter kit is the TeleDongle USB to
      RF interface.  If you plug it in to your Mac or Linux computer it should
      &#8220;just work&#8221;, showing up as a serial port device.  Windows systems need
      driver information that is part of the AltOS download to know that the
      existing USB modem driver will work.  We therefore recommend installing
      our software before plugging in TeleDongle if you are using a Windows
      computer.  If you are using an older version of Linux and are having 
      problems, try moving to a fresher kernel (2.6.33 or newer). 
    </p><p>
      Next you should obtain and install the AltOS software.  The AltOS
      distribution includes the AltosUI ground station program, current 
      firmware
      images for all of the hardware, and a number of standalone
      utilities that are rarely needed.  Pre-built binary packages are
      available for Linux, Microsoft Windows, and recent MacOSX
      versions.  Full source code and build instructions are also
      available.  The latest version may always be downloaded from
      <a class="ulink" href="http://altusmetrum.org/AltOS" target="_top">http://altusmetrum.org/AltOS</a>.
    </p><p>
      If you're using a TeleBT instead of the TeleDongle, you'll want to 
      install the AltosDroid application from the Google Play store on an 
      Android device. You don't need a data plan to use AltosDroid, but 
      without network access, the Map view will be less useful as it
      won't contain any map data. You can also use TeleBT connected
      over USB with your laptop computer; it acts exactly like a
      TeleDongle. Anywhere this manual talks about TeleDongle, you can
      also read that as 'and TeleBT when connected via USB'.
    </p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="idp52963536"></a>Chapter 3. Handling Precautions</h1></div></div></div><p>
      All Altus Metrum products are sophisticated electronic devices.  
      When handled gently and properly installed in an air-frame, they
      will deliver impressive results.  However, as with all electronic 
      devices, there are some precautions you must take.
    </p><p>
      The Lithium Polymer rechargeable batteries have an
      extraordinary power density.  This is great because we can fly with
      much less battery mass than if we used alkaline batteries or previous
      generation rechargeable batteries... but if they are punctured
      or their leads are allowed to short, they can and will release their
      energy very rapidly!
      Thus we recommend that you take some care when handling our batteries
      and consider giving them some extra protection in your air-frame.  We
      often wrap them in suitable scraps of closed-cell packing foam before
      strapping them down, for example.
    </p><p>
      The barometric sensors used on all of our flight computers are 
      sensitive to sunlight.  In normal mounting situations, the baro sensor
      and all of the other surface mount components
      are &#8220;down&#8221; towards whatever the underlying mounting surface is, so
      this is not normally a problem.  Please consider this when designing an 
      installation in an air-frame with a see-through plastic payload bay.  It
      is particularly important to
      consider this with TeleMini v1.0, both because the baro sensor is on the
      &#8220;top&#8221; of the board, and because many model rockets with payload bays
      use clear plastic for the payload bay!  Replacing these with an opaque
      cardboard tube, painting them, or wrapping them with a layer of masking
      tape are all reasonable approaches to keep the sensor out of direct
      sunlight.
    </p><p>
      The barometric sensor sampling port must be able to &#8220;breathe&#8221;,
      both by not being covered by foam or tape or other materials that might
      directly block the hole on the top of the sensor, and also by having a
      suitable static vent to outside air.
    </p><p>
      As with all other rocketry electronics, Altus Metrum altimeters must 
      be protected from exposure to corrosive motor exhaust and ejection 
      charge gasses.

	Here are general instructions for hooking up an Altus Metrum
	flight computer. Instructions specific to each model will be
	found in the section devoted to that model below.
      </p><p>
	To prevent electrical interference from affecting the
	operation of the flight computer, it's important to always
	twist pairs of wires connected to the board. Twist the switch
	leads, the pyro leads and the battery leads. This reduces
	interference through a mechanism called common mode rejection.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp52735728"></a>1.1. Hooking Up Lithium Polymer Batteries</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  All Altus Metrum flight computers have a two pin JST PH
	  series connector to connect up a single-cell Lithium Polymer
	  cell (3.7V nominal). You can purchase matching batteries
	  from the Altus Metrum store, or other vendors, or you can
	  make your own. Pin 1 of the connector is positive, pin 2 is
	  negative. Spark Fun sells a cable with the connector
	  attached, which they call a <a class="ulink" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9914" target="_top">JST Jumper 2
	  Wire Assembly</a>.
	</p><p>
	  Many RC vendors also sell lithium polymer batteries with
	  this same connector. All that we have found use the opposite
	  polarity, and if you use them that way, you will damage or
	  destroy the flight computer.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp48868096"></a>1.2. Hooking Up Pyro Charges</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Altus Metrum flight computers always have two screws for
	  each pyro charge. This means you shouldn't need to put two
	  wires into a screw terminal or connect leads from pyro
	  charges together externally.
	</p><p>
	  On the flight computer, one lead from each charge is hooked
	  to the positive battery terminal through the power switch.
	  The other lead is connected through the pyro circuit, which
	  is connected to the negative battery terminal when the pyro
	  circuit is fired.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp52685344"></a>1.3. Hooking Up a Power Switch</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Altus Metrum flight computers need an external power switch
	  to turn them on. This disconnects both the computer and the
	  pyro charges from the battery, preventing the charges from
	  firing when in the Off position. The switch is in-line with
	  the positive battery terminal.
	</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp52416288"></a>1.3.1. Using an External Active Switch Circuit</h4></div></div></div><p>
	    You can use an active switch circuit, such as the
	    Featherweight Magnetic Switch, with any Altus Metrum
	    flight computer. These require three connections, one to
	    the battery, one to the positive power input on the flight
	    computer and one to ground. Find instructions on how to
	    hook these up for each flight computer below. The follow
	    the instructions that come with your active switch to
	    connect it up.
	  </p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp51098304"></a>1.4. Using a Separate Pyro Battery</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  As mentioned above in the section on hooking up pyro
	  charges, one lead for each of the pyro charges is connected
	  through the power switch directly to the positive battery
	  terminal. The other lead is connected to the pyro circuit,
	  which connects it to the negative battery terminal when the
	  pyro circuit is fired. The pyro circuit on all of the flight
	  computers is designed to handle up to 16V.
	</p><p>
	  To use a separate pyro battery, connect the negative pyro
	  battery terminal to the flight computer ground terminal,
	  the positive battery terminal to the igniter and the other
	  igniter lead to the negative pyro terminal on the flight
	  computer. When the pyro channel fires, it will complete the
	  circuit between the negative pyro terminal and the ground
	  terminal, firing the igniter. Specific instructions on how
	  to hook this up will be found in each section below.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp52841344"></a>1.5. Using a Different Kind of Battery</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  EasyMini and TeleMini v2 are designed to use either a
	  lithium polymer battery or any other battery producing
	  between 4 and 12 volts, such as a rectangular 9V
	  battery. TeleMega and TeleMetrum are not designed for this,
	  and must only be powered by a lithium polymer battery. Find
	  instructions on how to use other batteries in the EasyMini
	  and TeleMini sections below.

	TeleMetrum is a 1 inch by 2¾ inch circuit board.  It was designed to
	fit inside coupler for 29mm air-frame tubing, but using it in a tube that
	small in diameter may require some creativity in mounting and wiring
	to succeed!  The presence of an accelerometer means TeleMetrum should
	be aligned along the flight axis of the airframe, and by default the ¼
	wave UHF wire antenna should be on the nose-cone end of the board.  The
	antenna wire is about 7 inches long, and wiring for a power switch and
	the e-matches for apogee and main ejection charges depart from the
	fin can end of the board, meaning an ideal &#8220;simple&#8221; avionics
	bay for TeleMetrum should have at least 10 inches of interior length.

	TeleMini v1.0 is ½ inches by 1½ inches.  It was
	designed to fit inside an 18mm air-frame tube, but using it in
	a tube that small in diameter may require some creativity in
	mounting and wiring to succeed!  Since there is no
	accelerometer, TeleMini can be mounted in any convenient
	orientation.  The default ¼ wave UHF wire antenna attached to
	the center of one end of the board is about 7 inches long. Two
	wires for the power switch are connected to holes in the
	middle of the board. Screw terminals for the e-matches for
	apogee and main ejection charges depart from the other end of
	the board, meaning an ideal &#8220;simple&#8221; avionics bay for TeleMini
	should have at least 9 inches of interior length.

	The on-board flash is partitioned into separate flight logs,
	each of a fixed maximum size. Increase the maximum size of
	each log and you reduce the number of flights that can be
	stored. Decrease the size and you can store more flights.
      </p><p>
	Configuration data is also stored in the flash memory on
	TeleMetrum v1.x, TeleMini and EasyMini. This consumes 64kB
	of flash space.  This configuration space is not available
	for storing flight log data. TeleMetrum v2.0 and TeleMega
	store configuration data in a bit of eeprom available within
	the processor chip, leaving that space available in flash for
	more flight data.
      </p><p>
	To compute the amount of space needed for a single flight, you
	can multiply the expected ascent time (in seconds) by 100
	times bytes-per-sample, multiply the expected descent time (in
	seconds) by 10 times the bytes per sample and add the two
	together. That will slightly under-estimate the storage (in
	bytes) needed for the flight. For instance, a TeleMetrum v2.0 flight spending
	20 seconds in ascent and 150 seconds in descent will take
	about (20 * 1600) + (150 * 160) = 56000 bytes of storage. You
	could store dozens of these flights in the on-board flash.
      </p><p>
	The default size allows for several flights on each flight
	computer, except for TeleMini v1.0, which only holds data for a
	single flight. You can adjust the size.
      </p><p>
	Altus Metrum flight computers will not overwrite existing
	flight data, so be sure to download flight data and erase it
	from the flight computer before it fills up. The flight
	computer will still successfully control the flight even if it
	cannot log data, so the only thing you will lose is the data.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp53968528"></a>9. Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>
	A typical installation involves attaching 
	only a suitable battery, a single pole switch for 
	power on/off, and two pairs of wires connecting e-matches for the 
	apogee and main ejection charges.  All Altus Metrum products are 
	designed for use with single-cell batteries with 3.7 volts
	nominal. TeleMini v2.0 and EasyMini may also be used with other
	batteries as long as they supply between 4 and 12 volts. 
      </p><p>
	The battery connectors are a standard 2-pin JST connector and
	match batteries sold by Spark Fun. These batteries are
	single-cell Lithium Polymer batteries that nominally provide 3.7
	volts.  Other vendors sell similar batteries for RC aircraft
	using mating connectors, however the polarity for those is
	generally reversed from the batteries used by Altus Metrum
	products. In particular, the Tenergy batteries supplied for use
	in Featherweight flight computers are not compatible with Altus
	Metrum flight computers or battery chargers. <span class="emphasis"><em>Check
	polarity and voltage before connecting any battery not purchased
	from Altus Metrum or Spark Fun.</em></span>
      </p><p>
	By default, we use the unregulated output of the battery directly
	to fire ejection charges.  This works marvelously with standard
	low-current e-matches like the J-Tek from MJG Technologies, and with
	Quest Q2G2 igniters.  However, if you want or need to use a separate 
	pyro battery, check out the &#8220;External Pyro Battery&#8221; section in this 
	manual for instructions on how to wire that up. The altimeters are 
	designed to work with an external pyro battery of no more than 15 volts.
      </p><p>
	Ejection charges are wired directly to the screw terminal block
	at the aft end of the altimeter.  You'll need a very small straight 
	blade screwdriver for these screws, such as you might find in a 
	jeweler's screwdriver set.
      </p><p>
	Except for TeleMini v1.0, the flight computers also use the
	screw terminal block for the power switch leads. On TeleMini v1.0,
	the power switch leads are soldered directly to the board and
	can be connected directly to a switch.
      </p><p>
	For most air-frames, the integrated antennas are more than
	adequate.   However, if you are installing in a carbon-fiber or
	metal electronics bay which is opaque to RF signals, you may need to
	use off-board external antennas instead.  In this case, you can
	replace the stock UHF antenna wire with an edge-launched SMA connector,
	and, on TeleMetrum v1, you can unplug the integrated GPS
	antenna and select an appropriate off-board GPS antenna with
	cable terminating in a U.FL connector.

        The AltOS firmware build for the altimeters has two
        fundamental modes, &#8220;idle&#8221; and &#8220;flight&#8221;.  Which of these modes
        the firmware operates in is determined at start up time. For
        TeleMetrum and TeleMega, which have accelerometers, the mode is 
	controlled by the orientation of the
        rocket (well, actually the board, of course...) at the time
        power is switched on.  If the rocket is &#8220;nose up&#8221;, then
        the flight computer assumes it's on a rail or rod being prepared for
        launch, so the firmware chooses flight mode.  However, if the
        rocket is more or less horizontal, the firmware instead enters
        idle mode.  Since TeleMini v2.0 and EasyMini don't have an
        accelerometer we can use to determine orientation, &#8220;idle&#8221; mode
        is selected if the board is connected via USB to a computer,
        otherwise the board enters &#8220;flight&#8221; mode. TeleMini v1.0
        selects &#8220;idle&#8221; mode if it receives a command packet within the
        first five seconds of operation.
      </p><p>
        At power on, you will hear three beeps or see three flashes
        (&#8220;S&#8221; in Morse code for start up) and then a pause while
        the altimeter completes initialization and self test, and decides 
	which mode to enter next.
      </p><p>
	Here's a short summary of all of the modes and the beeping (or
	flashing, in the case of TeleMini v1) that accompanies each
	mode. In the description of the beeping pattern, &#8220;dit&#8221; means a
	short beep while "dah" means a long beep (three times as
	long). &#8220;Brap&#8221; means a long dissonant tone.

        In flight or &#8220;pad&#8221; mode, the altimeter engages the flight
        state machine, goes into transmit-only mode to send telemetry,
        and waits for launch to be detected.  Flight mode is indicated
        by an &#8220;di-dah-dah-dit&#8221; (&#8220;P&#8221; for pad) on the beeper or lights,
        followed by beeps or flashes indicating the state of the
        pyrotechnic igniter continuity.  One beep/flash indicates
        apogee continuity, two beeps/flashes indicate main continuity,
        three beeps/flashes indicate both apogee and main continuity,
        and one longer &#8220;brap&#8221; sound which is made by rapidly
        alternating between two tones indicates no continuity.  For a
        dual deploy flight, make sure you're getting three beeps or
        flashes before launching!  For apogee-only or motor eject
        flights, do what makes sense.
      </p><p>
        If idle mode is entered, you will hear an audible &#8220;di-dit&#8221; or
        see two short flashes (&#8220;I&#8221; for idle), and the flight state
        machine is disengaged, thus no ejection charges will fire.
        The altimeters also listen for the radio link when in idle
        mode for requests sent via TeleDongle.  Commands can be issued
        in idle mode over either USB or the radio link
        equivalently. TeleMini v1.0 only has the radio link.  Idle
        mode is useful for configuring the altimeter, for extracting
        data from the on-board storage chip after flight, and for
        ground testing pyro charges.
      </p><p>
	In &#8220;Idle&#8221; and &#8220;Pad&#8221; modes, once the mode indication
	beeps/flashes and continuity indication has been sent, if
	there is no space available to log the flight in on-board
	memory, the flight computer will emit a warbling tone (much
	slower than the &#8220;no continuity tone&#8221;)
      </p><p>

	Once landed, the flight computer will signal that by emitting
	the &#8220;Landed&#8221; sound described above, after which it will beep
	out the apogee height (in meters). Each digit is represented
	by a sequence of short &#8220;dit&#8221; beeps, with a pause between
	digits. A zero digit is represented with one long &#8220;dah&#8221;
	beep. The flight computer will continue to report landed mode
	and beep out the maximum height until turned off.
      </p><p>
        One &#8220;neat trick&#8221; of particular value when TeleMetrum or TeleMega are used with 
        very large air-frames, is that you can power the board up while the 
        rocket is horizontal, such that it comes up in idle mode.  Then you can
        raise the air-frame to launch position, and issue a 'reset' command 
	via TeleDongle over the radio link to cause the altimeter to reboot and 
        come up in flight mode.  This is much safer than standing on the top 
        step of a rickety step-ladder or hanging off the side of a launch 
        tower with a screw-driver trying to turn on your avionics before 
        installing igniters!
      </p><p>
	TeleMini v1.0 is configured solely via the radio link. Of course, that
	means you need to know the TeleMini radio configuration values
	or you won't be able to communicate with it. For situations
	when you don't have the radio configuration values, TeleMini v1.0
	offers an 'emergency recovery' mode. In this mode, TeleMini is
	configured as follows:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Sets the radio frequency to 434.550MHz
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Sets the radio calibration back to the factory value.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Sets the callsign to N0CALL
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Does not go to 'pad' mode after five seconds.
	    </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><p>
	To get into 'emergency recovery' mode, first find the row of
	four small holes opposite the switch wiring. Using a short
	piece of small gauge wire, connect the outer two holes
	together, then power TeleMini up. Once the red LED is lit,
	disconnect the wire and the board should signal that it's in
	'idle' mode after the initial five second startup period.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54043808"></a>2. GPS </h2></div></div></div><p>
        TeleMetrum and TeleMega include a complete GPS receiver.  A
        complete explanation of how GPS works is beyond the scope of
        this manual, but the bottom line is that the GPS receiver
        needs to lock onto at least four satellites to obtain a solid
        3 dimensional position fix and know what time it is.
      </p><p>
        The flight computers provide backup power to the GPS chip any time a 
        battery is connected.  This allows the receiver to &#8220;warm start&#8221; on
        the launch rail much faster than if every power-on were a GPS 
	&#8220;cold start&#8221;.  In typical operations, powering up
        on the flight line in idle mode while performing final air-frame
        preparation will be sufficient to allow the GPS receiver to cold
        start and acquire lock.  Then the board can be powered down during
        RSO review and installation on a launch rod or rail.  When the board
        is turned back on, the GPS system should lock very quickly, typically
        long before igniter installation and return to the flight line are
        complete.

        One of the unique features of the Altus Metrum system is the
        ability to create a two way command link between TeleDongle
        and an altimeter using the digital radio transceivers
        built into each device. This allows you to interact with the
        altimeter from afar, as if it were directly connected to the
        computer.
      </p><p>
        Any operation which can be performed with a flight computer can
        either be done with the device directly connected to the
        computer via the USB cable, or through the radio
        link. TeleMini v1.0 doesn't provide a USB connector and so it is
        always communicated with over radio.  Select the appropriate 
        TeleDongle device when the list of devices is presented and 
        AltosUI will interact with an altimeter over the radio link.
      </p><p>
	One oddity in the current interface is how AltosUI selects the
	frequency for radio communications. Instead of providing
	an interface to specifically configure the frequency, it uses
	whatever frequency was most recently selected for the target
	TeleDongle device in Monitor Flight mode. If you haven't ever
	used that mode with the TeleDongle in question, select the
	Monitor Flight button from the top level UI, and pick the
	appropriate TeleDongle device.  Once the flight monitoring
	window is open, select the desired frequency and then close it
	down again. All radio communications will now use that frequency.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>

            flight computer by turning TeleMetrum or TeleMega on in &#8220;idle&#8221; mode,
            then once the air-frame is oriented for launch, you can
            reboot the altimeter and have it restart in pad mode
            without having to climb the scary ladder.

            loaded, then remotely command the altimeter to fire the
            igniters.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Operation over the radio link for configuring an altimeter, ground
        testing igniters, and so forth uses the same RF frequencies as flight
        telemetry.  To configure the desired TeleDongle frequency, select
        the monitor flight tab, then use the frequency selector and 
        close the window before performing other desired radio operations.
      </p><p>
        The flight computers only enable radio commanding in 'idle' mode.
	TeleMetrum and TeleMega use the accelerometer to detect which orientation they
	start up in, so make sure you have the flight computer lying horizontally when you turn
        it on. Otherwise, it will start in 'pad' mode ready for
        flight, and will not be listening for command packets from TeleDongle.
      </p><p>
	TeleMini listens for a command packet for five seconds after
	first being turned on, if it doesn't hear anything, it enters
	'pad' mode, ready for flight and will no longer listen for
	command packets. The easiest way to connect to TeleMini is to
	initiate the command and select the TeleDongle device. At this
	point, the TeleDongle will be attempting to communicate with
	the TeleMini. Now turn TeleMini on, and it should immediately
	start communicating with the TeleDongle and the desired
	operation can be performed.
      </p><p>
        You can monitor the operation of the radio link by watching the 
        lights on the devices. The red LED will flash each time a packet
        is transmitted, while the green LED will light up on TeleDongle when 
        it is waiting to receive a packet from the altimeter.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp47751840"></a>4. Ground Testing </h2></div></div></div><p>
        An important aspect of preparing a rocket using electronic deployment
        for flight is ground testing the recovery system.  Thanks
        to the bi-directional radio link central to the Altus Metrum system,
        this can be accomplished in a TeleMega, TeleMetrum or TeleMini equipped rocket 
        with less work than you may be accustomed to with other systems.  It 
        can even be fun!
      </p><p>
        Just prep the rocket for flight, then power up the altimeter
        in &#8220;idle&#8221; mode (placing air-frame horizontal for TeleMetrum or TeleMega, or
        selecting the Configure Altimeter tab for TeleMini).  This will cause 
        the firmware to go into &#8220;idle&#8221; mode, in which the normal flight
        state machine is disabled and charges will not fire without
        manual command.  You can now command the altimeter to fire the apogee
        or main charges from a safe distance using your computer and 
        TeleDongle and the Fire Igniter tab to complete ejection testing.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp47754592"></a>5. Radio Link </h2></div></div></div><p>
        Our flight computers all incorporate an RF transceiver, but
        it's not a full duplex system... each end can only be transmitting or
        receiving at any given moment.  So we had to decide how to manage the
        link.
      </p><p>
        By design, the altimeter firmware listens for the radio link when
        it's in &#8220;idle mode&#8221;, which
        allows us to use the radio link to configure the rocket, do things like
        ejection tests, and extract data after a flight without having to
        crack open the air-frame.  However, when the board is in &#8220;flight
        mode&#8221;, the altimeter only
        transmits and doesn't listen at all.  That's because we want to put
        ultimate priority on event detection and getting telemetry out of
        the rocket through
        the radio in case the rocket crashes and we aren't able to extract
        data later...
      </p><p>
        We don't generally use a 'normal packet radio' mode like APRS
        because they're just too inefficient.  The GFSK modulation we
        use is FSK with the base-band pulses passed through a Gaussian
        filter before they go into the modulator to limit the
        transmitted bandwidth.  When combined with forward error
        correction and interleaving, this allows us to have a very
        robust 19.2 kilobit data link with only 10-40 milliwatts of
        transmit power, a whip antenna in the rocket, and a hand-held
        Yagi on the ground.  We've had flights to above 21k feet AGL
        with great reception, and calculations suggest we should be
        good to well over 40k feet AGL with a 5-element yagi on the
        ground with our 10mW units and over 100k feet AGL with the
        40mW devices.  We hope to fly boards to higher altitudes over
        time, and would of course appreciate customer feedback on
        performance in higher altitude flights!
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp47758624"></a>6. APRS</h2></div></div></div><p>
	TeleMetrum v2.0 and TeleMega can send APRS if desired, and the
	interval between APRS packets can be configured. As each APRS
	packet takes a full second to transmit, we recommend an
	interval of at least 5 seconds to avoid consuming too much
	battery power or radio channel bandwidth. You can configure
	the APRS interval using AltosUI; that process is described in
	the Configure Altimeter section of the AltosUI chapter.
      </p><p>
	AltOS uses the APRS compressed position report data format,
	which provides for higher position precision and shorter
	packets than the original APRS format. It also includes
	altitude data, which is invaluable when tracking rockets. We
	haven't found a receiver which doesn't handle compressed
	positions, but it's just possible that you have one, so if you
	have an older device that can receive the raw packets but
	isn't displaying position information, it's possible that this
	is the cause.
      </p><p>
	The APRS packet format includes a comment field that can have
	arbitrary text in it. AltOS uses this to send status
	information about the flight computer. It sends four fields as
	shown in the following table.
      </p><div class="table"><a name="idp54084096"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 5.3. Altus Metrum APRS Comments</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table summary="Altus Metrum APRS Comments" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center" class="Field"><col align="center" class="Example"><col align="center" class="Description"></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center">Field</th><th align="center">Example</th><th align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">L</td><td align="center">GPS Status U for unlocked, L for locked</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">Number of Satellites in View</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">B4.0</td><td align="center">Altimeter Battery Voltage</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">A3.7</td><td align="center">Apogee Igniter Voltage</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">M3.7</td><td align="center">Main Igniter Voltage</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"><p>

      </p><p>
	Make sure your primary battery is above 3.8V, any connected
	igniters are above 3.5V and GPS is locked with at least 5 or 6
	satellites in view before flying. If GPS is switching between
	L and U regularly, then it doesn't have a good lock and you
	should wait until it becomes stable.
      </p><p>
	If the GPS receiver loses lock, the APRS data transmitted will
	contain the last position for which GPS lock was
	available. You can tell that this has happened by noticing
	that the GPS status character switches from 'L' to 'U'. Before
	GPS has locked, APRS will transmit zero for latitude,
	longitude and altitude.

        Configuring an Altus Metrum altimeter for flight is very
        simple.  Even on our baro-only TeleMini and EasyMini boards,
        the use of a Kalman filter means there is no need to set a
        &#8220;mach delay&#8221;.  The few configurable parameters can all be set
        using AltosUI over USB or or radio link via TeleDongle. Read
	the Configure Altimeter section in the AltosUI chapter below
	for more information.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54104976"></a>7.1. Radio Frequency</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Altus Metrum boards support radio frequencies in the 70cm
	  band. By default, the configuration interface provides a
	  list of 10 &#8220;standard&#8221; frequencies in 100kHz channels starting at
	  434.550MHz.  However, the firmware supports use of
	  any 50kHz multiple within the 70cm band. At any given
	  launch, we highly recommend coordinating when and by whom each
	  frequency will be used to avoid interference.  And of course, both
	  altimeter and TeleDongle must be configured to the same
	  frequency to successfully communicate with each other.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54107024"></a>7.2. Callsign</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  This sets the callsign used for telemetry, APRS and the
	  packet link. For telemetry and APRS, this is used to
	  identify the device. For the packet link, the callsign must
	  match that configured in AltosUI or the link will not
	  work. This is to prevent accidental configuration of another
	  Altus Metrum flight computer operating on the same frequency nearby.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54108560"></a>7.3. Telemetry/RDF/APRS Enable</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  You can completely disable the radio while in flight, if
	  necessary. This doesn't disable the packet link in idle
	  mode.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54109856"></a>7.4. APRS Interval</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  This selects how often APRS packets are transmitted. Set
	  this to zero to disable APRS without also disabling the
	  regular telemetry and RDF transmissions. As APRS takes a
	  full second to transmit a single position report, we
	  recommend sending packets no more than once every 5 seconds.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54111328"></a>7.5. Apogee Delay</h3></div></div></div><p>
          Apogee delay is the number of seconds after the altimeter detects flight
          apogee that the drogue charge should be fired.  In most cases, this
          should be left at the default of 0.  However, if you are flying
          redundant electronics such as for an L3 certification, you may wish
          to set one of your altimeters to a positive delay so that both
          primary and backup pyrotechnic charges do not fire simultaneously.
        </p><p>
          The Altus Metrum apogee detection algorithm fires exactly at
          apogee.  If you are also flying an altimeter like the
          PerfectFlite MAWD, which only supports selecting 0 or 1
          seconds of apogee delay, you may wish to set the MAWD to 0
          seconds delay and set the TeleMetrum to fire your backup 2
          or 3 seconds later to avoid any chance of both charges
          firing simultaneously.  We've flown several air-frames this
          way quite happily, including Keith's successful L3 cert.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54114384"></a>7.6. Main Deployment Altitude</h3></div></div></div><p>
          By default, the altimeter will fire the main deployment charge at an
          elevation of 250 meters (about 820 feet) above ground.  We think this
          is a good elevation for most air-frames, but feel free to change this
          to suit.  In particular, if you are flying two altimeters, you may
          wish to set the
          deployment elevation for the backup altimeter to be something lower
          than the primary so that both pyrotechnic charges don't fire
          simultaneously.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54116080"></a>7.7. Maximum Flight Log</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Changing this value will set the maximum amount of flight
	  log storage that an individual flight will use. The
	  available storage is divided into as many flights of the
	  specified size as can fit in the available space. You can
	  download and erase individual flight logs. If you fill up
	  the available storage, future flights will not get logged
	  until you erase some of the stored ones.
	</p><p>
	  Even though our flight computers (except TeleMini v1.0) can store
	  multiple flights, we strongly recommend downloading and saving
	  flight data after each flight.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54118224"></a>7.8. Ignite Mode</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Instead of firing one charge at apogee and another charge at
	  a fixed height above the ground, you can configure the
	  altimeter to fire both at apogee or both during
	  descent. This was added to support an airframe Bdale designed that 
	  had two altimeters, one in the fin can and one in the nose.
	</p><p>
	  Providing the ability to use both igniters for apogee or
	  main allows some level of redundancy without needing two
	  flight computers.  In Redundant Apogee or Redundant Main
	  mode, the two charges will be fired two seconds apart.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54120336"></a>7.9. Pad Orientation</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  TeleMetrum and TeleMega measure acceleration along the axis
	  of the board. Which way the board is oriented affects the
	  sign of the acceleration value. Instead of trying to guess
	  which way the board is mounted in the air frame, the
	  altimeter must be explicitly configured for either Antenna
	  Up or Antenna Down. The default, Antenna Up, expects the end
	  of the board connected to the 70cm antenna to be nearest the
	  nose of the rocket, with the end containing the screw
	  terminals nearest the tail.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54122032"></a>7.10. Configurable Pyro Channels</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  In addition to the usual Apogee and Main pyro channels,
	  TeleMega has four additional channels that can be configured
	  to activate when various flight conditions are
	  satisfied. You can select as many conditions as necessary;
	  all of them must be met in order to activate the
	  channel. The conditions available are:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Acceleration away from the ground. Select a value, and
	      then choose whether acceleration should be above or
	      below that value. Acceleration is positive upwards, so
	      accelerating towards the ground would produce negative
	      numbers. Acceleration during descent is noisy and
	      inaccurate, so be careful when using it during these
	      phases of the flight.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Vertical speed.  Select a value, and then choose whether
	      vertical speed should be above or below that
	      value. Speed is positive upwards, so moving towards the
	      ground would produce negative numbers. Speed during
	      descent is a bit noisy and so be careful when using it
	      during these phases of the flight.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Height. Select a value, and then choose whether the
	      height above the launch pad should be above or below
	      that value.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Orientation. TeleMega contains a 3-axis gyroscope and
	      accelerometer which is used to measure the current
	      angle. Note that this angle is not the change in angle
	      from the launch pad, but rather absolute relative to
	      gravity; the 3-axis accelerometer is used to compute the
	      angle of the rocket on the launch pad and initialize the
	      system. Because this value is computed by integrating
	      rate gyros, it gets progressively less accurate as the
	      flight goes on. It should have an accumulated error of
	      less than 0.2°/second (after 10 seconds of flight, the
	      error should be less than 2°).
	    </p><p>
	      The usual use of the orientation configuration is to
	      ensure that the rocket is traveling mostly upwards when
	      deciding whether to ignite air starts or additional
	      stages. For that, choose a reasonable maximum angle
	      (like 20°) and set the motor igniter to require an angle
	      of less than that value.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Flight Time. Time since boost was detected. Select a
	      value and choose whether to activate the pyro channel
	      before or after that amount of time.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Ascending. A simple test saying whether the rocket is
	      going up or not. This is exactly equivalent to testing
	      whether the speed is &gt; 0.

	      Descending. A simple test saying whether the rocket is

	      whether the speed is &lt; 0.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      After Motor. The flight software counts each time the
	      rocket starts accelerating (presumably due to a motor or
	      motors igniting). Use this value to count ignitions for
	      multi-staged or multi-airstart launches.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Delay. This value doesn't perform any checks, instead it
	      inserts a delay between the time when the other
	      parameters become true and when the pyro channel is
	      activated.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      Flight State. The flight software tracks the flight
	      through a sequence of states:
	      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
		    Boost. The motor has lit and the rocket is
		    accelerating upwards.
		  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		    Fast. The motor has burned out and the rocket is
		    decelerating, but it is going faster than 200m/s.
		  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		    Coast. The rocket is still moving upwards and
		    decelerating, but the speed is less than 200m/s.
		  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		    Drogue. The rocket has reached apogee and is heading
		    back down, but is above the configured Main

		  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		    Main. The rocket is still descending, and is below
		    the Main altitude
		  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
		    Landed. The rocket is no longer moving.
		  </p></li></ol></div><p>
	    </p><p>
	      You can select a state to limit when the pyro channel
	      may activate; note that the check is based on when the
	      rocket transitions <span class="emphasis"><em>into</em></span> the state, and so checking for
	      &#8220;greater than Boost&#8221; means that the rocket is currently
	      in boost or some later state.
	    </p><p>
	      When a motor burns out, the rocket enters either Fast or
	      Coast state (depending on how fast it is moving). If the
	      computer detects upwards acceleration again, it will
	      move back to Boost state.

      The AltosUI program provides a graphical user interface for
      interacting with the Altus Metrum product family. AltosUI can
      monitor telemetry data, configure devices and many other
      tasks. The primary interface window provides a selection of
      buttons, one for each major activity in the system.  This chapter
      is split into sections, each of which documents one of the tasks
      provided from the top-level toolbar.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54148128"></a>1. Monitor Flight</h2></div><div><h3 class="subtitle">Receive, Record and Display Telemetry Data</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Selecting this item brings up a dialog box listing all of the
        connected TeleDongle devices. When you choose one of these,
        AltosUI will create a window to display telemetry data as
        received by the selected TeleDongle device.
      </p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="279"><tr><td><img src="device-selection.png" width="279"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>
        All telemetry data received are automatically recorded in
        suitable log files. The name of the files includes the current
        date and rocket serial and flight numbers.
      </p><p>
        The radio frequency being monitored by the TeleDongle device is
        displayed at the top of the window. You can configure the
        frequency by clicking on the frequency box and selecting the desired
        frequency. AltosUI remembers the last frequency selected for each
        TeleDongle and selects that automatically the next time you use
        that device.
      </p><p>
        Below the TeleDongle frequency selector, the window contains a few
        significant pieces of information about the altimeter providing
        the telemetry data stream:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>The configured call-sign</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The device serial number</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The flight number. Each altimeter remembers how many
            times it has flown.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The rocket flight state. Each flight passes through several
            states including Pad, Boost, Fast, Coast, Drogue, Main and
            Landed.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The Received Signal Strength Indicator value. This lets
            you know how strong a signal TeleDongle is receiving. The
            radio inside TeleDongle operates down to about -99dBm;
            weaker signals may not be receivable. The packet link uses
            error detection and correction techniques which prevent
            incorrect data from being reported.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            The age of the displayed data, in seconds since the last

	    counting up, then you are no longer receiving data over the radio
	    link from the flight computer.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Finally, the largest portion of the window contains a set of
        tabs, each of which contain some information about the rocket.
        They're arranged in 'flight order' so that as the flight
        progresses, the selected tab automatically switches to display
        data relevant to the current state of the flight. You can select
        other tabs at any time. The final 'table' tab displays all of
        the raw telemetry values in one place in a spreadsheet-like format.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54161168"></a>1.1. Launch Pad</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="495"><tr><td><img src="launch-pad.png" width="495"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>
          The 'Launch Pad' tab shows information used to decide when the
          rocket is ready for flight. The first elements include red/green
          indicators, if any of these is red, you'll want to evaluate
          whether the rocket is ready to launch:
          </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Battery Voltage</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether the Li-Po battery powering the

		  the duration of the flight. A value of more than
		  3.8V is required for a 'GO' status.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Apogee Igniter Voltage</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether the apogee
		  igniter has continuity. If the igniter has a low
		  resistance, then the voltage measured here will be close
		  to the Li-Po battery voltage. A value greater than 3.2V is
		  required for a 'GO' status.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Main Igniter Voltage</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether the main
		  igniter has continuity. If the igniter has a low
		  resistance, then the voltage measured here will be close
		  to the Li-Po battery voltage. A value greater than 3.2V is
		  required for a 'GO' status.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">On-board Data Logging</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether there is
		  space remaining on-board to store flight data for the
		  upcoming flight. If you've downloaded data, but failed
		  to erase flights, there may not be any space
		  left. Most of our flight computers can store multiple 
		  flights, depending on the configured maximum flight log 
		  size. TeleMini v1.0 stores only a single flight, so it 
		  will need to be
		  downloaded and erased after each flight to capture
		  data. This only affects on-board flight logging; the
		  altimeter will still transmit telemetry and fire
		  ejection charges at the proper times even if the flight
		  data storage is full.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">GPS Locked</span></dt><dd><p>
		  For a TeleMetrum or TeleMega device, this indicates whether the GPS receiver is
		  currently able to compute position information. GPS requires
		  at least 4 satellites to compute an accurate position.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">GPS Ready</span></dt><dd><p>
		  For a TeleMetrum or TeleMega device, this indicates whether GPS has reported at least
		  10 consecutive positions without losing lock. This ensures
		  that the GPS receiver has reliable reception from the
		  satellites.
		</p></dd></dl></div><p>
        </p><p>
	  The Launchpad tab also shows the computed launch pad position
	  and altitude, averaging many reported positions to improve the
	  accuracy of the fix.

          This tab is shown during Boost, Fast and Coast
          phases. The information displayed here helps monitor the
          rocket as it heads towards apogee.
        </p><p>
          The height, speed, acceleration and tilt are shown along
          with the maximum values for each of them. This allows you to
          quickly answer the most commonly asked questions you'll hear
          during flight.
        </p><p>
          The current latitude and longitude reported by the GPS are
          also shown. Note that under high acceleration, these values
          may not get updated as the GPS receiver loses position
          fix. Once the rocket starts coasting, the receiver should
          start reporting position again.
        </p><p>
          Finally, the current igniter voltages are reported as in the
          Launch Pad tab. This can help diagnose deployment failures
          caused by wiring which comes loose under high acceleration.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54182256"></a>1.3. Descent</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="495"><tr><td><img src="descent.png" width="495"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>
          Once the rocket has reached apogee and (we hope) activated the
          apogee charge, attention switches to tracking the rocket on
          the way back to the ground, and for dual-deploy flights,
          waiting for the main charge to fire.
        </p><p>
          To monitor whether the apogee charge operated correctly, the
          current descent rate is reported along with the current
          height. Good descent rates vary based on the choice of recovery
	  components, but generally range from 15-30m/s on drogue and should
	  be below 10m/s when under the main parachute in a dual-deploy flight.
        </p><p>
          With GPS-equipped flight computers, you can locate the rocket in the
          sky using the elevation and bearing information to figure
          out where to look. Elevation is in degrees above the
          horizon. Bearing is reported in degrees relative to true
          north. Range can help figure out how big the rocket will
          appear. Ground Distance shows how far it is to a point
          directly under the rocket and can help figure out where the
          rocket is likely to land. Note that all of these values are
          relative to the pad location. If the elevation is near 90°,
          the rocket is over the pad, not over you.
        </p><p>
          Finally, the igniter voltages are reported in this tab as
          well, both to monitor the main charge as well as to see what
          the status of the apogee charge is.  Note that some commercial
	  e-matches are designed to retain continuity even after being
	  fired, and will continue to show as green or return from red to
	  green after firing.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54189120"></a>1.4. Landed</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="495"><tr><td><img src="landed.png" width="495"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>
          Once the rocket is on the ground, attention switches to
          recovery. While the radio signal is often lost once the
          rocket is on the ground, the last reported GPS position is
          generally within a short distance of the actual landing location.
        </p><p>
          The last reported GPS position is reported both by
          latitude and longitude as well as a bearing and distance from
          the launch pad. The distance should give you a good idea of
          whether to walk or hitch a ride.  Take the reported
          latitude and longitude and enter them into your hand-held GPS
          unit and have that compute a track to the landing location.
        </p><p>
	  Our flight computers will continue to transmit RDF
	  tones after landing, allowing you to locate the rocket by
	  following the radio signal if necessary. You may need to get 
	  away from the clutter of the flight line, or even get up on 
	  a hill (or your neighbor's RV roof) to receive the RDF signal.
	</p><p>
          The maximum height, speed and acceleration reported
          during the flight are displayed for your admiring observers.
	  The accuracy of these immediate values depends on the quality
	  of your radio link and how many packets were received.  
	  Recovering the on-board data after flight may yield
	  more precise results.
        </p><p>
	  To get more detailed information about the flight, you can
	  click on the 'Graph Flight' button which will bring up a
	  graph window for the current flight.

	  The table view shows all of the data available from the
	  flight computer. Probably the most useful data on
	  this tab is the detailed GPS information, which includes
	  horizontal dilution of precision information, and
	  information about the signal being received from the satellites.

          When the TeleMetrum has a GPS fix, the Site Map tab will map
          the rocket's position to make it easier for you to locate the
          rocket, both while it is in the air, and when it has landed. The
          rocket's state is indicated by color: white for pad, red for
          boost, pink for fast, yellow for coast, light blue for drogue,
          dark blue for main, and black for landed.
        </p><p>
          The map's scale is approximately 3m (10ft) per pixel. The map
          can be dragged using the left mouse button. The map will attempt
          to keep the rocket roughly centered while data is being received.
        </p><p>
          Images are fetched automatically via the Google Maps Static API,
          and cached on disk for reuse. If map images cannot be downloaded,
          the rocket's path will be traced on a dark gray background
          instead.

        The altimeter records flight data to its internal flash memory.
        TeleMetrum data is recorded at a much higher rate than the telemetry
        system can handle, and is not subject to radio drop-outs. As
        such, it provides a more complete and precise record of the
        flight. The 'Save Flight Data' button allows you to read the
        flash memory and write it to disk. 
      </p><p>
        Clicking on the 'Save Flight Data' button brings up a list of
        connected flight computers and TeleDongle devices. If you select a
        flight computer, the flight data will be downloaded from that
        device directly. If you select a TeleDongle device, flight data
        will be downloaded from a flight computer over radio link via the 
	specified TeleDongle. See the chapter on Controlling An Altimeter 
	Over The Radio Link for more information.
      </p><p>
	After the device has been selected, a dialog showing the
	flight data saved in the device will be shown allowing you to
	select which flights to download and which to delete. With
	version 0.9 or newer firmware, you must erase flights in order
	for the space they consume to be reused by another
	flight. This prevents accidentally losing flight data
	if you neglect to download data before flying again. Note that
	if there is no more space available in the device, then no
	data will be recorded during the next flight.
      </p><p>
        The file name for each flight log is computed automatically
        from the recorded flight date, altimeter serial number and
        flight number information.

          AltosUI logs all telemetry data and saves all TeleMetrum flash
          data to this directory. This directory is also used as the
          staring point when selecting data files for display or export.
        </p><p>
          Click on the directory name to bring up a directory choosing

          This value is transmitted in each command packet sent from 
	  TeleDongle and received from an altimeter.  It is not used in 
	  telemetry mode, as the callsign configured in the altimeter board
	  is included in all telemetry packets.  Configure this
          with the AltosUI operators call sign as needed to comply with
          your local radio regulations.
        </p><p>
	  Note that to successfully command a flight computer over the radio
	  (to configure the altimeter, monitor idle, or fire pyro charges), 
	  the callsign configured here must exactly match the callsign
	  configured in the flight computer.  This matching is case 
	  sensitive.

        Select this button and then select a TeleDongle Device from the list provided.
      </p><p>
        The first few lines of the dialog provide information about the
        connected device, including the product name,
        software version and hardware serial number. Below that are the
        individual configuration entries.
      </p><p>
	Note that the TeleDongle itself doesn't save any configuration
	data, the settings here are recorded on the local machine in
	the Java preferences database. Moving the TeleDongle to
	another machine, or using a different user account on the same
	machine will cause settings made here to have no effect.
      </p><p>
        At the bottom of the dialog, there are three buttons:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Save</span></dt><dd><p>
	      This writes any changes to the

          The radios in every Altus Metrum device are calibrated at the
          factory to ensure that they transmit and receive on the
          specified frequency.  To change a TeleDongle's calibration, 
	  you must reprogram the unit completely, so this entry simply

        This reprograms Altus Metrum devices with new
        firmware. TeleMetrum v1.x, TeleDongle, TeleMini and TeleBT are
        all reprogrammed by using another similar unit as a
        programming dongle (pair programming). TeleMega, TeleMetrum v2
        and EasyMini are all programmed directly over their USB ports
        (self programming).  Please read the directions for flashing
        devices in the Updating Device Firmware chapter below.

	This activates the igniter circuits in the flight computer to help 
	test recovery systems deployment. Because this command can operate
	over the Packet Command Link, you can prepare the rocket as
	for flight and then test the recovery system without needing
	to snake wires inside the air-frame.

	Selecting the 'Fire Igniter' button brings up the usual device
	selection dialog. Pick the desired device. This brings up another

	Next, select the desired igniter to fire. This will enable the
	'Arm' button.
      </p><p>
	Select the 'Arm' button. This enables the 'Fire' button. The

	This brings up a dialog similar to the Monitor Flight UI,
	except it works with the altimeter in &#8220;idle&#8221; mode by sending
	query commands to discover the current state rather than
	listening for telemetry packets. Because this uses command
	mode, it needs to have the TeleDongle and flight computer
	callsigns match exactly. If you can receive telemetry, but
	cannot manage to run Monitor Idle, then it's very likely that
	your callsigns are different in some way.

      AltosDroid provides the same flight monitoring capabilities as
      AltosUI, but runs on Android devices and is designed to connect
      to a TeleBT receiver over Bluetooth&#8482;. AltosDroid monitors
      telemetry data, logging it to internal storage in the Android
      device, and presents that data in a UI the same way the 'Monitor
      Flight' window does in AltosUI.
    </p><p>
      This manual will explain how to configure AltosDroid, connect
      to TeleBT, operate the flight monitoring interface and describe
      what the displayed data means.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54330640"></a>1. Installing AltosDroid</h2></div></div></div><p>
	AltosDroid is available from the Google Play store. To install
	it on your Android device, open the Google Play Store
	application and search for &#8220;altosdroid&#8221;. Make sure you don't
	have a space between &#8220;altos&#8221; and &#8220;droid&#8221; or you probably won't
	find what you want. That should bring you to the right page
	from which you can download and install the application.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54332576"></a>2. Connecting to TeleBT</h2></div></div></div><p>
	Press the Android 'Menu' button or soft-key to see the
	configuration options available. Select the 'Connect a device'
	option and then the 'Scan for devices' entry at the bottom to
	look for your TeleBT device. Select your device, and when it
	asks for the code, enter '1234'.
      </p><p>
	Subsequent connections will not require you to enter that
	code, and your 'paired' device will appear in the list without
	scanning.

	The only configuration option available for AltosDroid is
	which frequency to listen on. Press the Android 'Menu' button
	or soft-key and pick the 'Select radio frequency' entry. That
	brings up a menu of pre-set radio frequencies; pick the one
	which matches your altimeter.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54336032"></a>4. AltosDroid Flight Monitoring</h2></div></div></div><p>
	AltosDroid is designed to mimic the AltosUI flight monitoring
	display, providing separate tabs for each stage of your rocket
	flight along with a tab containing a map of the local area
	with icons marking the current location of the altimeter and
	the Android device.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp54337344"></a>4.1. Pad</h3></div></div></div><p>
          The 'Launch Pad' tab shows information used to decide when the
          rocket is ready for flight. The first elements include red/green
          indicators, if any of these is red, you'll want to evaluate
          whether the rocket is ready to launch:
          </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Battery Voltage</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether the Li-Po battery
		  powering the TeleMetrum has sufficient charge to last for
		  the duration of the flight. A value of more than
		  3.8V is required for a 'GO' status.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Apogee Igniter Voltage</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether the apogee
		  igniter has continuity. If the igniter has a low
		  resistance, then the voltage measured here will be close
		  to the Li-Po battery voltage. A value greater than 3.2V is
		  required for a 'GO' status.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Main Igniter Voltage</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether the main
		  igniter has continuity. If the igniter has a low
		  resistance, then the voltage measured here will be close
		  to the Li-Po battery voltage. A value greater than 3.2V is
		  required for a 'GO' status.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">On-board Data Logging</span></dt><dd><p>
		  This indicates whether there is
		  space remaining on-board to store flight data for the
		  upcoming flight. If you've downloaded data, but failed
		  to erase flights, there may not be any space
		  left. TeleMetrum can store multiple flights, depending
		  on the configured maximum flight log size. TeleMini
		  stores only a single flight, so it will need to be
		  downloaded and erased after each flight to capture
		  data. This only affects on-board flight logging; the
		  altimeter will still transmit telemetry and fire
		  ejection charges at the proper times.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">GPS Locked</span></dt><dd><p>
		  For a TeleMetrum or TeleMega device, this indicates whether the GPS receiver is
		  currently able to compute position information. GPS requires
		  at least 4 satellites to compute an accurate position.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">GPS Ready</span></dt><dd><p>
		  For a TeleMetrum or TeleMega device, this indicates whether GPS has reported at least
		  10 consecutive positions without losing lock. This ensures
		  that the GPS receiver has reliable reception from the
		  satellites.
		</p></dd></dl></div><p>
	</p><p>
	  The Launchpad tab also shows the computed launch pad position
	  and altitude, averaging many reported positions to improve the
	  accuracy of the fix.

	AltosDroid always saves every bit of telemetry data it
	receives. To download that to a computer for use with AltosUI,
	simply remove the SD card from your Android device, or connect
	your device to your computer's USB port and browse the files
	on that device. You will find '.telem' files in the TeleMetrum
	directory that will work with AltosUI directly.

        First off, in the US, you need an <a class="ulink" href="http://www.altusmetrum.org/Radio/" target="_top">amateur radio license</a> or
        other authorization to legally operate the radio transmitters that are part
        of our products.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54355104"></a>2. In the Rocket</h2></div></div></div><p>
          In the rocket itself, you just need a flight computer and
          a single-cell, 3.7 volt nominal Li-Po rechargeable battery.  An 
	  850mAh battery weighs less than a 9V alkaline battery, and will 
	  run a TeleMetrum or TeleMega for hours.
	  A 110mAh battery weighs less than a triple A battery and is a good
	  choice for use with TeleMini.
        </p><p>
          By default, we ship flight computers with a simple wire antenna.  
	  If your electronics bay or the air-frame it resides within is made 
	  of carbon fiber, which is opaque to RF signals, you may prefer to 
	  install an SMA connector so that you can run a coaxial cable to an 
	  antenna mounted elsewhere in the rocket.  However, note that the 
	  GPS antenna is fixed on all current products, so you really want
	  to install the flight computer in a bay made of RF-transparent
	  materials if at all possible.
        </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54357568"></a>3. On the Ground</h2></div></div></div><p>
          To receive the data stream from the rocket, you need an antenna and short
          feed-line connected to one of our <a class="ulink" href="http://www.altusmetrum.org/TeleDongle/" target="_top">TeleDongle</a> units.  If possible, use an SMA to BNC 
	adapter instead of feedline between the antenna feedpoint and 
	TeleDongle, as this will give you the best performance.  The
          TeleDongle in turn plugs directly into the USB port on a notebook
          computer.  Because TeleDongle looks like a simple serial port, your computer
          does not require special device drivers... just plug it in.
        </p><p>
	  The GUI tool, AltosUI, is written in Java and runs across
	  Linux, Mac OS and Windows. There's also a suite of C tools
	  for Linux which can perform most of the same tasks.
        </p><p>
	  Alternatively, a TeleBT attached with an SMA to BNC adapter at the
	  feed point of a hand-held yagi used in conjunction with an Android
	  device running AltosDroid makes an outstanding ground station.
        </p><p>
          After the flight, you can use the radio link to extract the more detailed data
          logged in either TeleMetrum or TeleMini devices, or you can use a mini USB cable to plug into the
          TeleMetrum board directly.  Pulling out the data without having to open up
          the rocket is pretty cool!  A USB cable is also how you charge the Li-Po
          battery, so you'll want one of those anyway... the same cable used by lots
          of digital cameras and other modern electronic stuff will work fine.
        </p><p>
          If your rocket lands out of sight, you may enjoy having a hand-held 
	  GPS receiver, so that you can put in a way-point for the last 
	  reported rocket position before touch-down.  This makes looking for 
	  your rocket a lot like Geo-Caching... just go to the way-point and 
	  look around starting from there.  AltosDroid on an Android device
	  with GPS receiver works great for this, too!
        </p><p>
          You may also enjoy having a ham radio &#8220;HT&#8221; that covers the 70cm band... you
          can use that with your antenna to direction-find the rocket on the ground
          the same way you can use a Walston or Beeline tracker.  This can be handy
          if the rocket is hiding in sage brush or a tree, or if the last GPS position
          doesn't get you close enough because the rocket dropped into a canyon, or
          the wind is blowing it across a dry lake bed, or something like that...  Keith
          currently uses a Yaesu VX-7R, Bdale has a Baofung UV-5R
	  which isn't as nice, but was a whole lot cheaper.
        </p><p>
          So, to recap, on the ground the hardware you'll need includes:
          </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>

          The best hand-held commercial directional antennas we've found for radio

            Arrow Antennas.
          </a>
          The 440-3 and 440-5 are both good choices for finding a
          TeleMetrum- or TeleMini- equipped rocket when used with a suitable 
	  70cm HT.  TeleDongle and an SMA to BNC adapter fit perfectly
	  between the driven element and reflector of Arrow antennas.

          Our software makes it easy to log the data from each flight, both the
          telemetry received during the flight itself, and the more
          complete data log recorded in the flash memory on the altimeter
          board.  Once this data is on your computer, our post-flight tools make it
          easy to quickly get to the numbers everyone wants, like apogee altitude,
          max acceleration, and max velocity.  You can also generate and view a
          standard set of plots showing the altitude, acceleration, and
          velocity of the rocket during flight.  And you can even export a TeleMetrum data file
          usable with Google Maps and Google Earth for visualizing the flight path
          in two or three dimensions!
        </p><p>
          Our ultimate goal is to emit a set of files for each flight that can be
          published as a web page per flight, or just viewed on your local disk with
          a web browser.

	  We've designed a simple GPS based radio tracker called TeleGPS.  
	  If all goes well, we hope to introduce this in the first
	  half of 2014.
	</p><p>
          We have designed and prototyped several &#8220;companion boards&#8221; that 
	  can attach to the companion connector on TeleMetrum and TeleMega
	  flight computers to collect more data, provide more pyro channels, 
	  and so forth.  We do not yet know if or when any of these boards
	  will be produced in enough quantity to sell.  If you have specific
	  interests for data collection or control of events in your rockets
	  beyond the capabilities of our existing productions, please let 
	  us know!
        </p><p>
          Because all of our work is open, both the hardware designs and the

      Building high-power rockets that fly safely is hard enough. Mix
      in some sophisticated electronics and a bunch of radio energy
      and some creativity and/or compromise may be required. This chapter
      contains some suggestions about how to install Altus Metrum
      products into a rocket air-frame, including how to safely and
      reliably mix a variety of electronics into the same air-frame.
    </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54379264"></a>1. Mounting the Altimeter</h2></div></div></div><p>
	The first consideration is to ensure that the altimeter is
	securely fastened to the air-frame. For most of our products, we 
	prefer nylon standoffs and nylon screws; they're good to at least 50G
	and cannot cause any electrical issues on the board.  Metal screws
	and standoffs are fine, too, just be careful to avoid electrical
	shorts!  For TeleMini v1.0, we usually cut small pieces of 1/16 inch 
	balsa to fit
	under the screw holes, and then take 2x56 nylon screws and
	screw them through the TeleMini mounting holes, through the
	balsa and into the underlying material.
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Make sure accelerometer-equipped products like TeleMetrum and
	    TeleMega are aligned precisely along the axis of
	    acceleration so that the accelerometer can accurately
	    capture data during the flight.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Watch for any metal touching components on the
	    board. Shorting out connections on the bottom of the board
	    can cause the altimeter to fail during flight.
	  </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54384096"></a>2. Dealing with the Antenna</h2></div></div></div><p>
	The antenna supplied is just a piece of solid, insulated,
	wire. If it gets damaged or broken, it can be easily
	replaced. It should be kept straight and not cut; bending or
	cutting it will change the resonant frequency and/or
	impedance, making it a less efficient radiator and thus
	reducing the range of the telemetry signal.
      </p><p>
	Keeping metal away from the antenna will provide better range
	and a more even radiation pattern. In most rockets, it's not
	entirely possible to isolate the antenna from metal
	components; there are often bolts, all-thread and wires from other
	electronics to contend with. Just be aware that the more stuff
	like this around the antenna, the lower the range.
      </p><p>
	Make sure the antenna is not inside a tube made or covered
	with conducting material. Carbon fiber is the most common
	culprit here -- CF is a good conductor and will effectively
	shield the antenna, dramatically reducing signal strength and
	range. Metallic flake paint is another effective shielding
	material which should be avoided around any antennas.
      </p><p>
	If the ebay is large enough, it can be convenient to simply
	mount the altimeter at one end and stretch the antenna out
	inside. Taping the antenna to the sled can keep it straight
	under acceleration. If there are metal rods, keep the
	antenna as far away as possible.
      </p><p>
	For a shorter ebay, it's quite practical to have the antenna
	run through a bulkhead and into an adjacent bay. Drill a small
	hole in the bulkhead, pass the antenna wire through it and
	then seal it up with glue or clay. We've also used acrylic
	tubing to create a cavity for the antenna wire. This works a
	bit better in that the antenna is known to stay straight and
	not get folded by recovery components in the bay. Angle the
	tubing towards the side wall of the rocket and it ends up
	consuming very little space.
      </p><p>
	If you need to place the UHF antenna at a distance from the
	altimeter, you can replace the antenna with an edge-mounted
	SMA connector, and then run 50&#937; coax from the board to the
	antenna. Building a remote antenna is beyond the scope of this
	manual.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54389664"></a>3. Preserving GPS Reception</h2></div></div></div><p>
	The GPS antenna and receiver used in TeleMetrum and TeleMega is 
	highly sensitive and normally have no trouble tracking enough
	satellites to provide accurate position information for
	recovering the rocket. However, there are many ways the GPS signal
	can end up attenuated, negatively affecting GPS performance. 
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Conductive tubing or coatings. Carbon fiber and metal
	    tubing, or metallic paint will all dramatically attenuate the
	    GPS signal. We've never heard of anyone successfully
	    receiving GPS from inside these materials.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Metal components near the GPS patch antenna. These will
	    de-tune the patch antenna, changing the resonant frequency
	    away from the L1 carrier and reduce the effectiveness of the
	    antenna. You can place as much stuff as you like beneath the
	    antenna as that's covered with a ground plane. But, keep
	    wires and metal out from above the patch antenna.
	  </p></li></ol></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54394448"></a>4. Radio Frequency Interference</h2></div></div></div><p>
	Any altimeter will generate RFI; the digital circuits use
	high-frequency clocks that spray radio interference across a
	wide band. Altus Metrum altimeters generate intentional radio
	signals as well, increasing the amount of RF energy around the board.
      </p><p>
	Rocketry altimeters also use precise sensors measuring air
	pressure and acceleration. Tiny changes in voltage can cause
	these sensor readings to vary by a huge amount. When the
	sensors start mis-reporting data, the altimeter can either
	fire the igniters at the wrong time, or not fire them at all.
      </p><p>
	Voltages are induced when radio frequency energy is
	transmitted from one circuit to another. Here are things that
	influence the induced voltage and current:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Keep wires from different circuits apart. Moving circuits
	    further apart will reduce RFI.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Avoid parallel wires from different circuits. The longer two
	  wires run parallel to one another, the larger the amount of
	  transferred energy. Cross wires at right angles to reduce
	  RFI.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Twist wires from the same circuits. Two wires the same
	  distance from the transmitter will get the same amount of
	  induced energy which will then cancel out. Any time you have
	  a wire pair running together, twist the pair together to
	  even out distances and reduce RFI. For altimeters, this
	  includes battery leads, switch hookups and igniter
	  circuits.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  Avoid resonant lengths. Know what frequencies are present
	  in the environment and avoid having wire lengths near a
	  natural resonant length. Altus Metrum products transmit on the
	  70cm amateur band, so you should avoid lengths that are a
	  simple ratio of that length; essentially any multiple of ¼
	  of the wavelength (17.5cm).
	  </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54402016"></a>5. The Barometric Sensor</h2></div></div></div><p>
	Altusmetrum altimeters measure altitude with a barometric
	sensor, essentially measuring the amount of air above the
	rocket to figure out how high it is. A large number of
	measurements are taken as the altimeter initializes itself to
	figure out the pad altitude. Subsequent measurements are then
	used to compute the height above the pad.
      </p><p>
	To accurately measure atmospheric pressure, the ebay
	containing the altimeter must be vented outside the
	air-frame. The vent must be placed in a region of linear
	airflow, have smooth edges, and away from areas of increasing or 
	decreasing pressure.
      </p><p>
	All barometric sensors are quite sensitive to chemical damage from 
	the products of APCP or BP combustion, so make sure the ebay is 
	carefully sealed from any compartment which contains ejection 
	charges or motors.
      </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54404816"></a>6. Ground Testing</h2></div></div></div><p>
	The most important aspect of any installation is careful
	ground testing. Bringing an air-frame up to the LCO table which
	hasn't been ground tested can lead to delays or ejection
	charges firing on the pad, or, even worse, a recovery system
	failure.
      </p><p>
	Do a 'full systems' test that includes wiring up all igniters
	without any BP and turning on all of the electronics in flight
	mode. This will catch any mistakes in wiring and any residual
	RFI issues that might accidentally fire igniters at the wrong
	time. Let the air-frame sit for several minutes, checking for
	adequate telemetry signal strength and GPS lock.  If any igniters
	fire unexpectedly, find and resolve the issue before loading any
	BP charges!
      </p><p>
	Ground test the ejection charges. Prepare the rocket for
	flight, loading ejection charges and igniters. Completely
	assemble the air-frame and then use the 'Fire Igniters'
	interface through a TeleDongle to command each charge to
	fire. Make sure the charge is sufficient to robustly separate
	the air-frame and deploy the recovery system.
      </p></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="idp54407984"></a>Chapter 10. Updating Device Firmware</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#idp54412000">1.

      TeleMega, TeleMetrum v2 and EasyMini are all programmed directly
      over their USB connectors (self programming). TeleMetrum v1, TeleMini and
      TeleDongle are all programmed by using another device as a
      programmer (pair programming). It's important to recognize which
      kind of devices you have before trying to reprogram them.
    </p><p>
      You may wish to begin by ensuring you have current firmware images.
      These are distributed as part of the AltOS software bundle that
      also includes the AltosUI ground station program.  Newer ground
      station versions typically work fine with older firmware versions,
      so you don't need to update your devices just to try out new
      software features.  You can always download the most recent
      version from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.altusmetrum.org/AltOS/" target="_top">http://www.altusmetrum.org/AltOS/</a>.
    </p><p>
      If you need to update the firmware on a TeleDongle, we recommend 
      updating the altimeter first, before updating TeleDongle.  However,
      note that TeleDongle rarely need to be updated.  Any firmware version
      1.0.1 or later will work, version 1.2.1 may have improved receiver
      performance slightly.
    </p><p>
      Self-programmable devices (TeleMega, TeleMetrum v2 and EasyMini)
      are reprogrammed by connecting them to your computer over USB

        Be careful removing the programming cable from the locking 8-pin
        connector on TeleMetrum.  You'll need a fingernail or perhaps a thin
        screwdriver or knife blade to gently pry the locking ears out
        slightly to extract the connector.  We used a locking connector on
        TeleMetrum to help ensure that the cabling to companion boards
        used in a rocket don't ever come loose accidentally in flight.

        <span class="emphasis"><em>TeleMetrum seems to shut off when disconnected from the
        computer.</em></span>  
	Make sure the battery is adequately charged.  Remember the
        unit will pull more power than the USB port can deliver before the
        GPS enters &#8220;locked&#8221; mode.  The battery charges best when TeleMetrum
        is turned off.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>It's impossible to stop the TeleDongle when it's in &#8220;p&#8221; mode, I have
        to unplug the USB cable? </em></span>
	Make sure you have tried to &#8220;escape out&#8221; of
        this mode.  If this doesn't work the reboot procedure for the
        TeleDongle *is* to simply unplug it. 'cu' however will retain it's
        outgoing buffer IF your &#8220;escape out&#8221; ('~~') does not work.
        At this point using either 'ao-view' (or possibly
        'cutemon') instead of 'cu' will 'clear' the issue and allow renewed
        communication.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>The amber LED (on the TeleMetrum) lights up when both
        battery and USB are connected. Does this mean it's charging? 
	</em></span>
        Yes, the yellow LED indicates the charging at the 'regular' rate.
        If the led is out but the unit is still plugged into a USB port,
        then the battery is being charged at a 'trickle' rate.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>There are no &#8220;dit-dah-dah-dit&#8221; sound or lights like the manual 
	mentions?</em></span>
        That's the &#8220;pad&#8221; mode.  Weak batteries might be the problem.
        It is also possible that the flight computer is horizontal and the 
	output
        is instead a &#8220;dit-dit&#8221; meaning 'idle'. For TeleMini, it's possible that
	it received a command packet which would have left it in &#8220;pad&#8221; mode.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>How do I save flight data?</em></span>
        Live telemetry is written to file(s) whenever AltosUI is connected
        to the TeleDongle.  The file area defaults to ~/TeleMetrum
        but is easily changed using the menus in AltosUI. The files that
        are written end in '.telem'. The after-flight
        data-dumped files will end in .eeprom and represent continuous data
        unlike the .telem files that are subject to losses
        along the RF data path.
        See the above instructions on what and how to save the eeprom stored
        data after physically retrieving your altimeter.  Make sure to save
        the on-board data after each flight; while the TeleMetrum can store
	multiple flights, you never know when you'll lose the altimeter...
      </p></div><div class="appendix"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="idp54542272"></a>Appendix A. Notes for Older Software</h1></div></div></div><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>
      Before AltosUI was written, using Altus Metrum devices required
      some finesse with the Linux command line. There was a limited
      GUI tool, ao-view, which provided functionality similar to the
      Monitor Flight window in AltosUI, but everything else was a
      fairly 80's experience. This appendix includes documentation for
      using that software.
      </em></span>
    </p><p>
      Both TeleMetrum and TeleDongle can be directly communicated
      with using USB ports. The first thing you should try after getting
      both units plugged into to your computer's USB port(s) is to run
      'ao-list' from a terminal-window to see what port-device-name each
      device has been assigned by the operating system.
      You will need this information to access the devices via their
      respective on-board firmware and data using other command line
      programs in the AltOS software suite.
    </p><p>
      TeleMini can be communicated with through a TeleDongle device
      over the radio link. When first booted, TeleMini listens for a
      TeleDongle device and if it receives a packet, it goes into
      'idle' mode. Otherwise, it goes into 'pad' mode and waits to be
      launched. The easiest way to get it talking is to start the
      communication link on the TeleDongle and the power up the
      TeleMini board.
    </p><p>
      To access the device's firmware for configuration you need a terminal
      program such as you would use to talk to a modem.  The software
      authors prefer using the program 'cu' which comes from the UUCP package
      on most Unix-like systems such as Linux.  An example command line for
      cu might be 'cu -l /dev/ttyACM0', substituting the correct number
      indicated from running the
      ao-list program.  Another reasonable terminal program for Linux is
      'cutecom'.  The default 'escape'
      character used by CU (i.e. the character you use to
      issue commands to cu itself instead of sending the command as input
      to the connected device) is a '~'. You will need this for use in
      only two different ways during normal operations. First is to exit
      the program by sending a '~.' which is called a 'escape-disconnect'
      and allows you to close-out from 'cu'. The
      second use will be outlined later.
    </p><p>
      All of the Altus Metrum devices share the concept of a two level
      command set in their firmware.
      The first layer has several single letter commands. Once
      you are using 'cu' (or 'cutecom') sending (typing) a '?'
      returns a full list of these
      commands. The second level are configuration sub-commands accessed
      using the 'c' command, for
      instance typing 'c?' will give you this second level of commands
      (all of which require the
      letter 'c' to access).  Please note that most configuration options
      are stored only in Flash memory; TeleDongle doesn't provide any storage
      for these options and so they'll all be lost when you unplug it.
    </p><p>
      Try setting these configuration ('c' or second level menu) values.  A good
      place to start is by setting your call sign.  By default, the boards
      use 'N0CALL' which is cute, but not exactly legal!
      Spend a few minutes getting comfortable with the units, their
      firmware, and 'cu' (or possibly 'cutecom').
      For instance, try to send
      (type) a 'c r 2' and verify the channel change by sending a 'c s'.
      Verify you can connect and disconnect from the units while in your
      terminal program by sending the escape-disconnect mentioned above.
    </p><p>
          To set the radio frequency, use the 'c R' command to specify the
	  radio transceiver configuration parameter. This parameter is computed
	  using the desired frequency, 'F', the radio calibration parameter, 'C' (showed by the 'c s' command) and
	  the standard calibration reference frequency, 'S', (normally 434.550MHz):
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
	    R = F / S * C
	  </pre><p>
	  Round the result to the nearest integer value.
          As with all 'c' sub-commands, follow this with a 'c w' to write the
          change to the parameter block in the on-board flash on
          your altimeter board if you want the change to stay in place across reboots.
        </p><p>
          To set the apogee delay, use the 'c d' command.
          As with all 'c' sub-commands, follow this with a 'c w' to write the
          change to the parameter block in the on-board DataFlash chip.
        </p><p>
          To set the main deployment altitude, use the 'c m' command.
          As with all 'c' sub-commands, follow this with a 'c w' to write the
          change to the parameter block in the on-board DataFlash chip.
        </p><p>
          To calibrate the radio frequency, connect the UHF antenna port to a
          frequency counter, set the board to 434.550MHz, and use the 'C'
          command to generate a CW carrier.  Wait for the transmitter temperature
          to stabilize and the frequency to settle down.
          Then, divide 434.550 MHz by the
          measured frequency and multiply by the current radio cal value show
          in the 'c s' command.  For an unprogrammed board, the default value
          is 1186611 for cc1111 based products and 7119667 for cc1120
	  based products.  Take the resulting integer and program it using the 'c f'
          command.  Testing with the 'C' command again should show a carrier
          within a few tens of Hertz of the intended frequency.
          As with all 'c' sub-commands, follow this with a 'c w' to write the
          change to the configuration memory.
        </p><p>
      Note that the 'reboot' command, which is very useful on the altimeters,
      will likely just cause problems with the dongle.  The *correct* way
      to reset the dongle is just to unplug and re-plug it.
    </p><p>
      A fun thing to do at the launch site and something you can do while
      learning how to use these units is to play with the radio link access
      between an altimeter and the TeleDongle.  Be aware that you *must* create
      some physical separation between the devices, otherwise the link will
      not function due to signal overload in the receivers in each device.
    </p><p>
      Now might be a good time to take a break and read the rest of this
      manual, particularly about the two &#8220;modes&#8221; that the altimeters
      can be placed in. TeleMetrum uses the position of the device when booting
      up will determine whether the unit is in &#8220;pad&#8221; or &#8220;idle&#8221; mode. TeleMini
      enters &#8220;idle&#8221; mode when it receives a command packet within the first 5 seconds
      of being powered up, otherwise it enters &#8220;pad&#8221; mode.
    </p><p>
      You can access an altimeter in idle mode from the TeleDongle's USB
      connection using the radio link
      by issuing a 'p' command to the TeleDongle. Practice connecting and
      disconnecting ('~~' while using 'cu') from the altimeter.  If
      you cannot escape out of the &#8220;p&#8221; command, (by using a '~~' when in
      CU) then it is likely that your kernel has issues.  Try a newer version.
    </p><p>
      Using this radio link allows you to configure the altimeter, test
      fire e-matches and igniters from the flight line, check pyro-match
      continuity and so forth. You can leave the unit turned on while it
      is in 'idle mode' and then place the
      rocket vertically on the launch pad, walk away and then issue a
      reboot command.  The altimeter will reboot and start sending data
      having changed to the &#8220;pad&#8221; mode. If the TeleDongle is not receiving
      this data, you can disconnect 'cu' from the TeleDongle using the
      procedures mentioned above and THEN connect to the TeleDongle from
      inside 'ao-view'. If this doesn't work, disconnect from the
      TeleDongle, unplug it, and try again after plugging it back in.
    </p><p>
      In order to reduce the chance of accidental firing of pyrotechnic
      charges, the command to fire a charge is intentionally somewhat
      difficult to type, and the built-in help is slightly cryptic to
      prevent accidental echoing of characters from the help text back at
      the board from firing a charge.  The command to fire the apogee
      drogue charge is 'i DoIt drogue' and the command to fire the main
      charge is 'i DoIt main'.
    </p><p>
      On TeleMetrum, the GPS will eventually find enough satellites, lock in on them,
      and 'ao-view' will both auditorily announce and visually indicate
      that GPS is ready.
      Now you can launch knowing that you have a good data path and
      good satellite lock for flight data and recovery.  Remember
      you MUST tell ao-view to connect to the TeleDongle explicitly in
      order for ao-view to be able to receive data.
    </p><p>
      The altimeters provide RDF (radio direction finding) tones on
      the pad, during descent and after landing. These can be used to
      locate the rocket using a directional antenna; the signal
      strength providing an indication of the direction from receiver to rocket.
    </p><p>
      TeleMetrum also provides GPS tracking data, which can further simplify
      locating the rocket once it has landed. (The last good GPS data
      received before touch-down will be on the data screen of 'ao-view'.)
    </p><p>
      Once you have recovered the rocket you can download the eeprom
      contents using either 'ao-dumplog' (or possibly 'ao-eeprom'), over
      either a USB cable or over the radio link using TeleDongle.
      And by following the man page for 'ao-postflight' you can create
      various data output reports, graphs, and even KML data to see the
      flight trajectory in Google-earth. (Moving the viewing angle making
      sure to connect the yellow lines while in Google-earth is the proper
      technique.)
    </p><p>
      As for ao-view.... some things are in the menu but don't do anything
      very useful.  The developers have stopped working on ao-view to focus
      on a new, cross-platform ground station program.  So ao-view may or
      may not be updated in the future.  Mostly you just use
      the Log and Device menus.  It has a wonderful display of the incoming
      flight data and I am sure you will enjoy what it has to say to you
      once you enable the voice output!

        There are only two calibrations required for TeleMetrum and
        TeleMega, and only one for TeleDongle, TeleMini and EasyMini.
        All boards are shipped from the factory pre-calibrated, but
        the procedures are documented here in case they are ever
        needed.  Re-calibration is not supported by AltosUI, you must
        connect to the board with a serial terminal program and
        interact directly with the on-board command interpreter to
        effect calibration.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54594960"></a>1. Radio Frequency</h2></div></div></div><p>
          The radio frequency is synthesized from a clock based on the
          crystal on the board.  The actual frequency of this oscillator 
          must be measured to generate a calibration constant.  While our 
          GFSK modulation
          bandwidth is wide enough to allow boards to communicate even when
          their oscillators are not on exactly the same frequency, performance
          is best when they are closely matched.
          Radio frequency calibration requires a calibrated frequency counter.
          Fortunately, once set, the variation in frequency due to aging and
          temperature changes is small enough that re-calibration by customers
          should generally not be required.
        </p><p>
          To calibrate the radio frequency, connect the UHF antenna
          port to a frequency counter, set the board to 434.550MHz,
          and use the 'C' command in the on-board command interpreter
          to generate a CW carrier.  For USB-enabled boards, this is
          best done over USB.  For TeleMini v1, note that the only way
          to escape the 'C' command is via power cycle since the board
          will no longer be listening for commands once it starts
          generating a CW carrier.
	</p><p>
	  Wait for the transmitter temperature to stabilize and the frequency 
          to settle down.  Then, divide 434.550 MHz by the
          measured frequency and multiply by the current radio cal value show
          in the 'c s' command.  For an unprogrammed board, the default value
          is 1186611.  Take the resulting integer and program it using the 'c f'
          command.  Testing with the 'C' command again should show a carrier
          within a few tens of Hertz of the intended frequency.
          As with all 'c' sub-commands, follow this with a 'c w' to write the
          change to the parameter block in the on-board storage chip.
        </p><p>
	  Note that any time you re-do the radio frequency calibration, the
	  radio frequency is reset to the default 434.550 Mhz.  If you want
	  to use another frequency, you will have to set that again after
	  calibration is completed.
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp54600240"></a>2. TeleMetrum and TeleMega Accelerometers</h2></div></div></div><p>
          While barometric sensors are factory-calibrated,
          accelerometers are not, and so each must be calibrated once
          installed in a flight computer.  Explicitly calibrating the
          accelerometers also allows us to load any compatible device.
          We perform a two-point calibration using gravity.
        </p><p>
          To calibrate the acceleration sensor, use the 'c a 0' command.  You
          will be prompted to orient the board vertically with the UHF antenna
          up and press a key, then to orient the board vertically with the
          UHF antenna down and press a key.  Note that the accuracy of this
	  calibration depends primarily on how perfectly vertical and still
	  the board is held during the cal process.  As with all 'c' 
	  sub-commands, follow this with a 'c w' to write the
          change to the parameter block in the on-board DataFlash chip.
        </p><p>
          The +1g and -1g calibration points are included in each telemetry
          frame and are part of the header stored in onboard flash to be
	  downloaded after flight.  We always store and return raw ADC 
	  samples for each sensor... so nothing is permanently &#8220;lost&#8221; or 
	  &#8220;damaged&#8221; if the calibration is poor.
        </p><p>
         In the unlikely event an accel cal goes badly, it is possible
         that TeleMetrum or TeleMega may always come up in 'pad mode'
         and as such not be listening to either the USB or radio link.
         If that happens, there is a special hook in the firmware to
         force the board back in to 'idle mode' so you can re-do the
         cal.  To use this hook, you just need to ground the SPI clock
         pin at power-on.  This pin is available as pin 2 on the 8-pin
         companion connector, and pin 1 is ground.  So either
         carefully install a fine-gauge wire jumper between the two
         pins closest to the index hole end of the 8-pin connector, or
         plug in the programming cable to the 8-pin connector and use
         a small screwdriver or similar to short the two pins closest
         to the index post on the 4-pin end of the programming cable,
         and power up the board.  It should come up in 'idle mode'
         (two beeps), allowing a re-cal.

    Version 1.1.1 is a bug-fix release. It fixes a couple of bugs in
    AltosUI and one firmware bug that affects TeleMetrum version 1.0
    boards. Thanks to Bob Brown for help diagnosing the Google Earth
    file export issue, and for suggesting the addition of the Ground

    AltOS Firmware Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	TeleMetrum v1.0 boards use the AT45DB081D flash memory part to
	store flight data, which is different from later TeleMetrum
	boards. The AltOS v1.1 driver for this chip couldn't erase
	memory, leaving it impossible to delete flight data or update
	configuration values. This bug doesn't affect newer TeleMetrum
	boards, and it doesn't affect the safety of rockets flying
	version 1.1 firmware.

  </p><p>
    AltosUI Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Creating a Google Earth file (KML) from on-board flight data
	(EEPROM) would generate an empty file. The code responsible
	for reading the EEPROM file wasn't ever setting the GPS valid
	bits, and so the KML export code thought there was no GPS data
	in the file.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	The &#8220;Landed&#8221; tab was displaying all values in metric units,
	even when AltosUI was configured to display imperial
	units. Somehow I just missed this tab when doing the units stuff.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	The &#8220;Descent&#8221; tab displays the range to the rocket, which is a
	combination of the over-the-ground distance to the rockets
	current latitude/longitude and the height of the rocket. As
	such, it's useful for knowing how far away the rocket is, but
	difficult to use when estimating where the rocket might
	eventually land. A new &#8220;Ground Distance&#8221; field has been added
	which displays the distance to a spot right underneath the
	rocket.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Sensor data wasn't being displayed for TeleMini flight
	computers in Monitor Idle mode, including things like battery
	voltage. The code that picked which kinds of data to fetch
	from the flight computer was missing a check for TeleMini when
	deciding whether to fetch the analog sensor data.

  </p><p>
    AltOS Firmware Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add apogee-lockout value. Overrides the apogee detection logic to
	prevent incorrect apogee charge firing.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix a bug where the data reported in telemetry packets was
	from 320ms ago.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Force the radio frequency to 434.550MHz when the debug clock
	pin is connected to ground at boot time. This provides a way
	to talk to a TeleMini which is configured to some unknown frequency.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Provide RSSI values for Monitor Idle mode. This makes it easy to check radio
	range without needing to go to flight mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix a bug which caused the old received telemetry packets to
	be retransmitted over the USB link when the radio was turned
	off and back on.

  </p><p>
    AltosUI Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix a bug that caused GPS ready to happen too quickly. The
	software was using every telemetry packet to signal new GPS
	data, which caused GPS ready to be signalled after 10 packets
	instead of 10 GPS updates.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix Google Earth data export to work with recent versions. The
	google earth file loading code got a lot pickier, requiring
	some minor white space changes in the export code.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Make the look-n-feel configurable, providing a choice from
	the available options.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add an 'Age' element to mark how long since a telemetry packet
	has been received. Useful to quickly gauge whether
	communications with the rocket are still active.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add 'Configure Ground Station' dialog to set the radio
	frequency used by a particular TeleDongle without having to go
	through the flight monitor UI.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add configuration for the new apogee-lockout value. A menu provides a list of
	reasonable values, or the value can be set by hand.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Changed how flight data are downloaded. Now there's an initial
	dialog asking which flights to download, and after that
	finishes, a second dialog comes up asking which flights to delete.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Re-compute time spent in each state for the flight graph; this
	figures out the actual boost and landing times instead of
	using the conservative values provide by the flight
	electronics. This improves the accuracy of the boost
	acceleration and main descent rate computations.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Make AltosUI run on Mac OS Lion. The default Java heap space
	was dramatically reduced for this release causing much of the
	UI to fail randomly. This most often affected the satellite
	mapping download and displays.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Change how data are displayed in the 'table' tab of the flight
	monitoring window. This eliminates entries duplicated from the
	header and adds both current altitude and pad altitude, which
	are useful in 'Monitor Idle' mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add Imperial units mode to present data in feet instead of
	meters.

    Version 1.0.1 is a major release, adding support for the TeleMini
    device and lots of new AltosUI features
  </p><p>
    AltOS Firmware Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add TeleMini v1.0 support. Firmware images for TeleMini are
	included in AltOS releases.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Change telemetry to be encoded in multiple 32-byte packets. This
	enables support for TeleMini and other devices without requiring
	further updates to the TeleDongle firmware.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Support operation of TeleMetrum with the antenna pointing
	aft. Previous firmware versions required the antenna to be
	pointing upwards, now there is a configuration option allowing
	the antenna to point aft, to aid installation in some airframes.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Ability to disable telemetry. For airframes where an antenna
	just isn't possible, or where radio transmissions might cause
	trouble with other electronics, there's a configuration option
	to disable all telemetry. Note that the board will still
	enable the radio link in idle mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Arbitrary frequency selection. The radios in Altus Metrum
	devices can be programmed to a wide range of frequencies, so
	instead of limiting devices to 10 pre-selected 'channels', the
	new firmware allows the user to choose any frequency in the
	70cm band. Note that the RF matching circuit on the boards is
	tuned for around 435MHz, so frequencies far from that may
	reduce the available range.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Kalman-filter based flight-tracking. The model based sensor
	fusion approach of a Kalman filter means that AltOS now
	computes apogee much more accurately than before, generally
	within a fraction of a second. In addition, this approach
	allows the baro-only TeleMini device to correctly identify
	Mach transitions, avoiding the error-prone selection of a Mach
	delay.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    AltosUI Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Wait for altimeter when using packet mode. Instead of quicly
	timing out when trying to initialize a packet mode
	configuration connection, AltosUI now waits indefinitely for
	the remote device to appear, providing a cancel button should
	the user get bored. This is necessary as the TeleMini can only
	be placed in "Idle" mode if AltosUI is polling it.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add main/apogee voltage graphs to the data plot. This provides
	a visual indication if the igniters fail before being fired.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Scan for altimeter devices by watching the defined telemetry
	frequencies. This avoids the problem of remembering what
	frequency a device was configured to use, which is especially
	important with TeleMini which does not include a USB connection.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Monitor altimeter state in "Idle" mode. This provides much of
	the information presented in the "Pad" dialog from the Monitor
	Flight command, monitoring the igniters, battery and GPS
	status withing requiring the flight computer to be armed and
	ready for flight.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Pre-load map images from home. For those launch sites which
	don't provide free Wi-Fi, this allows you to download the
	necessary satellite images given the location of the launch
	site. A list of known launch sites is maintained at
	altusmetrum.org which AltosUI downloads to populate a menu; if
	you've got a launch site not on that list, please send the
	name of it, latitude and longitude along with a link to the
	web site of the controlling club to the altusmetrum mailing list.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Flight statistics are now displayed in the Graph data
	window. These include max height/speed/accel, average descent
	rates and a few other bits of information. The Graph Data
	window can now be reached from the 'Landed' tab in the Monitor
	Flight window so you can immediately see the results of a
	flight.

  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
      Support for TeleMetrum v1.1 hardware. Sources for the flash
      memory part used in v1.0 dried up, so v1.1 uses a different part
      which required a new driver and support for explicit flight log
      erasing.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Multiple flight log support. This stores more than one flight
      log in the on-board flash memory. It also requires the user to
      explicitly erase flights so that you won't lose flight logs just
      because you fly the same board twice in one day.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Telemetry support for devices with serial number &gt;=
      256. Previous versions used a telemetry packet format that
      provided only 8 bits for the device serial number. This change
      requires that both ends of the telemetry link be running the 0.9
      firmware or they will not communicate.

      can export graphs to PNG files, or print them directly.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Real-time moving map which overlays the in-progress flight on
      satellite imagery fetched from Google Maps. This lets you see in
      pictures where your rocket has landed, allowing you to plan
      recovery activities more accurately.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Wireless recovery system testing. Prep your rocket for flight

    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Optimized flight status displays. Each flight state now has it's
      own custom 'tab' in the flight monitoring window so you can
      focus on the most important details. Pre-flight, the system
      shows a set of red/green status indicators for battery voltage,
      apogee/main igniter continutity and GPS reception. Wait until
      they're all green and your rocket is ready for flight. There are
      also tabs for ascent, descent and landing along with the
      original tabular view of the data.

      saved.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Download logged data from TeleMetrum devices, either through a
      direct USB connection or over the air through a TeleDongle
      device.

      Configure a TeleMetrum device, setting the radio channel,
      callsign, apogee delay and main deploy height. This can be done
      through either a USB connection or over a radio link via a
      TeleDongle device.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Replay a flight in real-time. This takes a saved telemetry log
      or eeprom download and replays it through the user interface so
      you can relive your favorite rocket flights.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Reprogram Altus Metrum devices. Using an Altus Metrum device
      connected via USB, another Altus Metrum device can be
      reprogrammed using the supplied programming cable between the
      two devices.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Export Flight data to a comma-separated-values file. This takes
      either telemetry or on-board flight data and generates data
      suitable for use in external applications. All data is exported
      using standard units so that no device-specific knowledge is
      needed to handle the data.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
      Speak to you during the flight. Instead of spending the flight
      hunched over your laptop looking at the screen, enjoy the view
      while the computer tells you what&#8217;s going on up there. During
      ascent, you hear the current flight state and altitude
      information. During descent, you get azimuth, elevation and
