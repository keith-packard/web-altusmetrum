<h2 id="_introduction_and_overview">1. Introduction and Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome to the Altus Metrum community!  Our circuits and software reflect
our passion for both hobby rocketry and Free Software.  We hope their
capabilities and performance will delight you in every way, but by
releasing all of our hardware and software designs under open licenses,
we also hope to empower you to take as active a role in our collective
future as you wish!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our goal is to include in this document all of the information required
to successfully configure and use Altus Metrum products.  But
documentation is a lot like software in that it can contain "bugs",
and can probably always be improved!  If you have questions that
aren&#8217;t answered in this manual, or just need a little help figuring
things out, we strongly suggest joining the Altus Metrum user email
list, which you can do by visiting
<a href="https://lists.gag.com/mailman/listinfo/altusmetrum" class="bare">https://lists.gag.com/mailman/listinfo/altusmetrum</a>.  There&#8217;s a lot
of useful information in the mailing list archives!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first device created for our community was TeleMetrum, a dual
deploy altimeter with fully integrated GPS and radio telemetry
as standard features, and a “companion interface” that will
support optional capabilities in the future. The latest version
of TeleMetrum, v2.0, has all of the same features but with
improved sensors and radio to offer increased performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our second device was TeleMini, a dual deploy altimeter with
radio telemetry and radio direction finding. The first version
of this device was only 13mm by 38mm (½ inch by 1½ inches) and
could fit easily in an 18mm air-frame. The latest version, v3.0,
includes a beeper, higher power radio, extended on-board
flight logging and an improved barometric sensor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMega is our most sophisticated device, including six pyro
channels (four of which are fully programmable), integrated GPS,
integrated gyroscopes for staging/air-start inhibit and high
performance telemetry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EasyMini is a dual-deploy altimeter with logging and built-in
USB data download.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EasyMega is essentially a TeleMega board with the GPS receiver
and telemetry transmitter removed. It offers the same 6 pyro
channels and integrated gyroscopes for staging/air-start inhibit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleDongle v0.2 was our first ground station, providing a USB to RF
interfaces for communicating with the altimeters. Combined with
your choice of antenna and notebook computer, TeleDongle and our
associated user interface software form a complete ground
station capable of logging and displaying in-flight telemetry,
aiding rocket recovery, then processing and archiving flight
data for analysis and review. The latest version, TeleDongle
v3, has all new electronics with a higher performance radio
for improved range.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a slightly more portable ground station experience that also
provides direct rocket recovery support, TeleBT offers flight
monitoring and data logging using a  Bluetooth™ connection between
the receiver and an Android device that has the AltosDroid
application installed from the Google Play store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More products will be added to the Altus Metrum family over time, and
we currently envision that this will be a single, comprehensive manual
for the entire product family.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_getting_started">2. Getting Started</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing to do after you open the box is to hook up a
battery and charge it if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_batteries">2.1. Batteries</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For TeleMetrum, TeleMega and EasyMega, the battery can be charged by plugging it into the
corresponding socket of the device and then using the USB
cable to plug the flight computer into your computer&#8217;s USB socket. The
on-board circuitry will charge the battery whenever it is plugged
in, because the on-off switch does NOT control the
charging circuitry.
The Lithium Polymer
TeleMini and
EasyMini battery can be charged by disconnecting it
from the board and plugging it into a standalone
battery charger such as <a href="http://altusmetrum.org/LipoCharger">LipoCharger</a>, and
connecting that via a USB cable to a laptop or other
USB power source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also choose to use another battery with
EasyMini, anything supplying between 4 and 12 volts should
work fine (like a standard 9V battery), but if you are planning
to fire pyro charges, ground testing is required to verify that
the battery supplies enough current to fire your chosen e-matches.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<tr>
<td class="icon">
<img src="./images/icons/note.svg" alt="Note">
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On TeleMetrum v1 boards, when the GPS chip is initially
searching for satellites, TeleMetrum will consume more current
than it pulls from the USB port, so the battery must be
attached in order to get satellite lock.  Once GPS is locked,
the current consumption goes back down enough to enable charging
while running. So it&#8217;s a good idea to fully charge the battery
as your first item of business so there is no issue getting and
maintaining satellite lock.  The yellow charge indicator led
will go out when the battery is nearly full and the charger goes
to trickle charge. It can take several hours to fully recharge a
deeply discharged battery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMetrum v2.0, TeleMega and EasyMega use a higher power battery charger,
allowing them to charge the battery while running the board at
maximum power. When the battery is charging, or when the board
is consuming a lot of power, the red LED will be lit. When the
battery is fully charged, the green LED will be lit. When the
battery is damaged or missing, both LEDs will be lit, which
appears yellow.</p>

<h3 id="_ground_station_hardware">2.2. Ground Station Hardware</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two ground stations available, the TeleDongle USB to
RF interface and the TeleBT Bluetooth/USB to RF interface.  If
you plug either of these in to your Mac or Linux computer it should
“just work”, showing up as a serial port device.  Windows systems need
driver information that is part of the AltOS download to know that the
existing USB modem driver will work.  We therefore recommend installing
our software before plugging in TeleDongle if you are using a Windows
computer.  If you are using an older version of Linux and are having
problems, try moving to a fresher kernel (2.6.33 or
newer).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_linuxmacwindows_ground_station_software">2.3. Linux/Mac/Windows Ground Station Software</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next you should obtain and install the AltOS software.
The AltOS distribution includes the AltosUI ground
station program, current firmware images for all of
the hardware, and a number of standalone utilities
that are rarely needed.  Pre-built binary packages are
available for Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX. Full
source code and build instructions are also
available. The latest version may always be downloaded

<p>Here are general instructions for hooking up an Altus Metrum
flight computer. Instructions specific to each model will be
found in the section devoted to that model below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_wiring_and_electrical_interference">3.1. Wiring and Electrical Interference</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To prevent electrical interference from affecting the
operation of the flight computer, it&#8217;s important to always

<h3 id="_using_a_separate_pyro_battery_with_telemini_v3">5.2. Using a Separate Pyro Battery with TeleMini v3</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described above, using an external pyro battery involves
connecting the negative battery terminal to the flight
computer ground, connecting the positive battery terminal to
one of the igniter leads and connecting the other igniter
lead to the per-channel pyro circuit connection. Because
there is no solid ground connection to use on TeleMini, this
is not recommended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only available ground connection on TeleMini v3 are
the two mounting holes next to the telemetry
antenna. Somehow connect a small piece of wire to one of
those holes and hook it to the negative pyro battery terminal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connecting the positive battery terminal to the pyro
charges must be done separate from TeleMini v3, by soldering
them together or using some other connector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other lead from each pyro charge is then inserted into
the appropriate per-pyro channel screw terminal (terminal 3 for the
Main charge, terminal 1 for the Apogee charge).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_an_active_switch_with_telemini_v3">5.3. Using an Active Switch with TeleMini v3</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As explained above, an external active switch requires three
connections, one to the positive battery terminal, one to
the flight computer positive input and one to ground. Again,
because TeleMini doesn&#8217;t have any good ground connection,
this is not recommended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The positive battery terminal is available on the Right
power switch wire, the positive flight computer input is on
the left power switch wire. Hook a lead to either of the
mounting holes for a ground connection.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_packet_link_mode_with_telemini">5.4. Using Packet Link Mode with TeleMini</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After TeleMini powers up, it will check to see if some
device is attempting to communicate with it using
Packet Link Mode. If so, it will switch to idle mode
and start communicating. To switch to flight mode,
reboot the device either over the radio link or by
powering it off and back on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no ground station is attempting to communicate
using Packet Link Mode, TeleMini will enter pad mode
and prepare for flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sequence of operations to use Packet Link Mode
with TeleMini is:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Configure the ground station data rate, frequency
and callsign to match the TeleMini settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start Packet Link Mode in the ground station by
selecting the desired operation (Safe Flight Data,
Configure Altimeter, Fire Igniter or Monitor
Idle). Select the TeleBT or TeleDongle device. The
red LED should begin flashing rapidly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn on TeleMini. You should see the red LED flash
very rapidly during the initial communication burst,
but it should then slow down when the link is idle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once TeleMini is in Idle mode, it will stay in that
mode until rebooted. That means you can stop one
Packet Link operation, wait a while and start another
Packet Link operation.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_forcing_telemini_radio_parameters_to_known_defaults">5.5. Forcing TeleMini radio parameters to known defaults</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what the TeleMini frequency and
callsign settings are, you can temporarily force it
back to the original default values (frequency
434.550MHz, callsign N0CALL) by connecting a wire
between hole 3 and hole 7 on the debug connector. Hole
3 has the square pad around it, hole 7 is the one
nearest the MS5607 baro sensor, which is a rectangular
component with a metal cap that has two holes in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once TeleMini has been powered up with this wire
connected, the wire may be removed. The radio
parameters will stay set to these default values until
changed by the user or when the device is rebooted.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>EasyMega provides explicit support for an external pyro
battery. All that is required is to remove the jumper
between the lipo terminal (Bottom 3) and the pyro terminal
(Bottom 2). Then hook the negative pyro battery terminal to ground
(Bottom 1) and the positive pyro battery to the pyro battery
input (Bottom 2). You can then use the existing pyro screw
terminals to hook up all of the pyro charges.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_only_one_battery_with_easymega">8.3. Using Only One Battery With EasyMega</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because EasyMega has built-in support for a separate pyro
battery, if you want to fly with just one battery running
both the computer and firing the charges, you need to
connect the flight computer battery to the pyro
circuit. EasyMega has two screw terminals for this—hook a
wire from the Lipo terminal (Bottom 3) to the Pyro terminal
(Bottom 2).</p>

<h2 id="_installation">9. Installation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical installation involves attaching
only a suitable battery, a single pole switch for
power on/off, and two pairs of wires connecting e-matches for the
apogee and main ejection charges.  All Altus Metrum products are
designed for use with single-cell batteries with 3.7 volts
nominal.
EasyMini may also be used with other
batteries as long as they supply between 4 and 12 volts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The battery connectors are a standard 2-pin JST connector; you
can purchase suitable batteries from the any vendor selling
Altus Metrum products. These batteries are
single-cell Lithium Polymer batteries that nominally provide 3.7
volts.  Other vendors sell similar batteries for RC aircraft
using mating connectors, however the polarity for those is
generally reversed from the batteries used by Altus Metrum
products. In particular, the Tenergy batteries supplied for use
in Featherweight flight computers are not compatible with Altus
Metrum flight computers or battery chargers.</p>

the battery to shut down when firing the igniter circuit. Do
not use these batteries unless you remove the current limiting

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, we use the unregulated output of the battery
directly to fire ejection charges.  This works marvelously
with standard low-current e-matches like the J-Tek from MJG
Technologies, and with Quest Q2G2 igniters.  However, if you
want or need to use a separate pyro battery, check out
<a href="#_using_a_separate_pyro_battery">Using a Separate Pyro Battery</a> for instructions on how to wire
that up. The altimeters are designed to work with an external
pyro battery of no more than 15 volts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ejection charges are wired directly to the screw terminal block
at the aft end of the altimeter.  You&#8217;ll need a very small straight
blade screwdriver for these screws, such as you might find in a
jeweler&#8217;s screwdriver set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Except for TeleMini v1.0, the flight computers also use the
screw terminal block for the power switch leads. On TeleMini v1.0,
the power switch leads are soldered directly to the board and
can be connected directly to a switch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most air-frames, the integrated antennas are more than
adequate.   However, if you are installing in a carbon-fiber or
metal electronics bay which is opaque to RF signals, you may need to
use off-board external antennas instead.  In this case, you can
replace the stock UHF antenna wire with an edge-launched SMA connector,
and, on TeleMetrum v1, you can unplug the integrated GPS
antenna and select an appropriate off-board GPS antenna with
cable terminating in a U.FL connector.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_being_legal">10.1. Being Legal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the US, you need an
<a href="http://www.altusmetrum.org/Radio/">amateur radio license</a>
or other authorization to legally operate the radio
transmitters that are part of our products.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_in_the_rocket">10.2. In the Rocket</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the rocket itself, you just need a flight computer
and a single-cell, 3.7 volt nominal Li-Po rechargeable
battery.
An 850mAh battery weighs less than a 9V
alkaline battery, and will run a TeleMetrum, TeleMega
or EasyMega for hours.
A 110mAh battery weighs less
than a triple A battery and is a good choice for use
with
TeleMini or
EasyMini.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, we ship TeleMini, TeleMetrum and TeleMega
flight computers with a simple wire antenna.  If your
electronics bay or the air-frame it resides within is
made of carbon fiber, which is opaque to RF signals,
you may prefer to install an SMA connector so that you
can run a coaxial cable to an antenna mounted
elsewhere in the rocket.  However, note that the GPS
antenna is fixed on all current products, so you
really want to install the flight computer in a bay
made of RF-transparent materials if at all possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_on_the_ground">10.3. On the Ground</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To receive the data stream from the rocket, you need
an antenna and short feed-line connected to one of our
<a href="http://www.altusmetrum.org/TeleDongle/">TeleDongle</a>
units.  If possible, use an SMA to BNC adapter instead
of feedline between the antenna feedpoint and
TeleDongle, as this will give you the best
performance.  The TeleDongle in turn plugs directly
into the USB port on a notebook computer.  Because
TeleDongle looks like a simple serial port, your
computer does not require special device
drivers&#8230;&#8203; just plug it in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GUI tool, AltosUI, is written in Java and runs
across Linux, Mac OS and Windows. There&#8217;s also a suite
of C tools for Linux which can perform most of the
same tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, a TeleBT attached with an SMA to BNC
adapter at the feed point of a hand-held yagi used in
conjunction with an Android device running AltosDroid
makes an outstanding ground station.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the flight,
you can use the radio link to
extract the more detailed data logged in either
TeleMetrum or TeleMini devices, or
you can use a
USB cable to plug into the flight computer board directly.
A USB cable is also how you
charge the Li-Po battery, so you&#8217;ll want one of those
anyway. The same cable used by lots of digital
cameras and other modern electronic stuff will work
fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your rocket lands out of sight, you may enjoy
having a hand-held GPS receiver, so that you can put
in a way-point for the last reported rocket position
before touch-down.  This makes looking for your rocket
a lot like Geo-Caching&#8230;&#8203; just go to the way-point and
look around starting from there.  AltosDroid on an
Android device with GPS receiver works great for this,
too!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may also enjoy having a ham radio “HT” that covers
the 70cm band&#8230;&#8203; you can use that with your antenna to
direction-find the rocket on the ground the same way
you can use a Walston or Beeline tracker.  This can be
handy if the rocket is hiding in sage brush or a tree,
or if the last GPS position doesn&#8217;t get you close
enough because the rocket dropped into a canyon, or
the wind is blowing it across a dry lake bed, or
something like that&#8230;&#8203;  Keith currently uses a Yaesu
FT1D, Bdale has a Yaesu VX-7R, which is a nicer radio
in most ways but doesn&#8217;t support APRS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, to recap, on the ground the hardware you&#8217;ll need includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>an antenna and feed-line or adapter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a TeleDongle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a notebook computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optionally, a hand-held GPS receiver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optionally, an HT or receiver covering 435 MHz</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best hand-held commercial directional antennas we&#8217;ve found for radio
direction finding rockets are from
<a href="http://www.arrowantennas.com/">Arrow Antennas</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 440-3 and 440-5 are both good choices for finding
a TeleMetrum- or TeleMini- equipped rocket when used
with a suitable 70cm HT.  TeleDongle and an SMA to BNC
adapter fit perfectly between the driven element and
reflector of Arrow antennas.</p>

<h3 id="_data_analysis">10.4. Data Analysis</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our software makes it easy to log the data from each
flight, both the telemetry received during the flight
itself, and the more complete data log recorded in the
flash memory on the altimeter board.  Once this data
is on your computer, our post-flight tools make it
easy to quickly get to the numbers everyone wants,
like apogee altitude, max acceleration, and max
velocity.  You can also generate and view a standard
set of plots showing the altitude, acceleration, and
velocity of the rocket during flight.  And you can
even export a flight log in a format usable with Google
Maps and Google Earth for visualizing the flight path
in two or three dimensions!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our ultimate goal is to emit a set of files for each
flight that can be published as a web page per flight,

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_future_plans">10.5. Future Plans</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have designed and prototyped several “companion
boards” that can attach to the companion connector on
TeleMetrum, TeleMega and EasyMega flight computers to
collect more data, provide more pyro channels, and so
forth.  We do not yet know if or when any of these
boards will be produced in enough quantity to sell.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AltosUI program provides a graphical user interface for
interacting with the Altus Metrum product family. AltosUI can
monitor telemetry data, configure devices and many other
tasks. The primary interface window provides a selection of
buttons, one for each major activity in the system.  This
chapter is split into sections, each of which documents one of
the tasks provided from the top-level toolbar.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_monitor_flight">11.1. Monitor Flight</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Selecting this item brings up a dialog box listing all
of the connected TeleDongle devices. When you choose
one of these, AltosUI will create a window to display
telemetry data as received by the selected TeleDongle
device.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 9. Device Selection Dialog</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All telemetry data received are automatically recorded
in suitable log files. The name of the files includes
the current date and rocket serial and flight numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The radio frequency being monitored by the TeleDongle
device is displayed at the top of the window. You can
configure the frequency by clicking on the frequency
box and selecting the desired frequency. AltosUI
remembers the last frequency selected for each
TeleDongle and selects that automatically the next
time you use that device.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below the TeleDongle frequency selector, the window
contains a few significant pieces of information about
the altimeter providing the telemetry data stream:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The configured call-sign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device serial number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flight number. Each altimeter remembers how
many times it has flown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rocket flight state. Each flight passes through
several states including Pad, Boost, Fast, Coast,
Drogue, Main and Landed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Received Signal Strength Indicator value. This
lets you know how strong a signal TeleDongle is
receiving. At the default data rate, 38400 bps, in
bench testing, the radio inside TeleDongle v0.2
operates down to about -106dBm, while the v3 radio
works down to about -111dBm.  Weaker signals, or an
environment with radio noise may cause the data to
not be received. The packet link uses error
detection and correction techniques which prevent
incorrect data from being reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The age of the displayed data, in seconds since the
last successfully received telemetry packet.  In
normal operation this will stay in the low single
digits.  If the number starts counting up, then you
are no longer receiving data over the radio link
from the flight computer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the largest portion of the window contains a
set of tabs, each of which contain some information
about the rocket.  They&#8217;re arranged in 'flight order'
so that as the flight progresses, the selected tab
automatically switches to display data relevant to the
current state of the flight. You can select other tabs
at any time. The final 'table' tab displays all of the
raw telemetry values in one place in a
spreadsheet-like format.</p>

<p>The 'Launch Pad' tab shows information used to decide when the
rocket is ready for flight. The first elements include red/green
indicators, if any of these is red, you&#8217;ll want to evaluate
whether the rocket is ready to launch:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Battery Voltage</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates whether the Li-Po battery powering the
flight computer has sufficient charge to last for
the duration of the flight. A value of more than
3.8V is required for a 'GO' status.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Apogee Igniter Voltage</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates whether the apogee
igniter has continuity. If the igniter has a low
resistance, then the voltage measured here will be close
to the Li-Po battery voltage. A value greater than 3.2V is
required for a 'GO' status.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Main Igniter Voltage</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates whether the main
igniter has continuity. If the igniter has a low
resistance, then the voltage measured here will be close
to the Li-Po battery voltage. A value greater than 3.2V is
required for a 'GO' status.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">On-board Data Logging</dt>
<dd>
<p>This indicates whether there is space remaining
on-board to store flight data for the upcoming
flight. If you&#8217;ve downloaded data, but failed to erase
flights, there may not be any space left. Most of our
flight computers can store multiple flights, depending
on the configured maximum flight log size. TeleMini
v1.0 stores only a single flight, so it will need to
be downloaded and erased after each flight to capture
data. This only affects on-board flight logging; the
altimeter will still transmit telemetry and fire
ejection charges at the proper times even if the
flight data storage is full.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">GPS Locked</dt>
<dd>
<p>For a TeleMetrum or TeleMega device, this indicates
whether the GPS receiver is currently able to compute
position information. GPS requires at least 4
satellites to compute an accurate position.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">GPS Ready</dt>
<dd>
<p>For a TeleMetrum or TeleMega device, this indicates
whether GPS has reported at least 10 consecutive
positions without losing lock. This ensures that the
GPS receiver has reliable reception from the
satellites.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The height, speed, acceleration and tilt are shown along
with the maximum values for each of them. This allows you to
quickly answer the most commonly asked questions you&#8217;ll hear

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current latitude and longitude reported by the GPS are
also shown. Note that under high acceleration, these values
may not get updated as the GPS receiver loses position
fix. Once the rocket starts coasting, the receiver should
start reporting position again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the current igniter voltages are reported as in the

<p>Once the rocket has reached apogee and (we hope)
activated the apogee charge, attention switches to
tracking the rocket on the way back to the ground, and
for dual-deploy flights, waiting for the main charge
to fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To monitor whether the apogee charge operated
correctly, the current descent rate is reported along
with the current height. Good descent rates vary based
on the choice of recovery components, but generally
range from 15-30m/s on drogue and should be below
10m/s when under the main parachute in a dual-deploy
flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With GPS-equipped flight computers, you can locate the
rocket in the sky using the elevation and bearing
information to figure out where to look. Elevation is
in degrees above the horizon. Bearing is reported in
degrees relative to true north. Range can help figure
out how big the rocket will appear. Ground Distance
shows how far it is to a point directly under the
rocket and can help figure out where the rocket is
likely to land. Note that all of these values are
relative to the pad location. If the elevation is near
90°, the rocket is over the pad, not over you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the igniter voltages are reported in this tab
as well, both to monitor the main charge as well as to
see what the status of the apogee charge is.  Note
that some commercial e-matches are designed to retain
continuity even after being fired, and will continue
to show as green or return from red to green after
firing.</p>

the rocket is on the ground, the last reported GPS
position is generally within a short distance of the
actual landing location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last reported GPS position is reported both by
latitude and longitude as well as a bearing and
distance from the launch pad. The distance should give
you a good idea of whether to walk or hitch a ride.

them into your hand-held GPS unit and have that
compute a track to the landing location.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_apogee_delay">11.6.2. Apogee Delay</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When flying redundant electronics, it&#8217;s often
important to ensure that multiple apogee charges don&#8217;t
fire at precisely the same time, as that can over
pressurize the apogee deployment bay and cause a
structural failure of the air-frame. The Apogee Delay
parameter tells the flight computer to fire the apogee
charge a certain number of seconds after apogee has
been detected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_apogee_lockout">11.6.3. Apogee Lockout</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apogee lockout is the number of seconds after launch
where the flight computer will not fire the apogee
charge, even if the rocket appears to be at
apogee. This is often called 'Mach Delay', as it is
intended to prevent a flight computer from
unintentionally firing apogee charges due to the
pressure spike that occurrs across a mach
transition. Altus Metrum flight computers include a
Kalman filter which is not fooled by this sharp
pressure increase, and so this setting should be left
at the default value of zero to disable it.</p>

<p>The flight software counts each time the rocket starts
accelerating and then decelerating (presumably due to a motor or
motors burning). Use this value for multi-staged or multi-airstart
launches. As of version 1.8.6 firmware, this checks to make sure at
least this many motors have burned. Before version 1.8.6, this checked
to make sure that exactly this many motors had burned.</p>

<dd>
<p>Once the other parameters all become true, a timer is
started for the specified amount of time. While the timer is running,
the other parameters are checked repeatedly and if any of them become
false, then the pyro channel is disabled and will not fire. If the
timer expires and all of the other parameters have remained true for
the entire time, then the pyro channel is fired.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Flight State</dt>
<dd>
<p>The flight software tracks the flight
through a sequence of states:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boost. The motor has lit and the rocket is
accelerating upwards. Ascent rate will be greater than zero.
Vertical acceleration will be greater than zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast. The motor has burned out and the
rocket is decelerating, but it is going
faster than 200m/s. Ascent rate will be greater than zero. Vertical
acceleration will be less than zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coast. The rocket is still moving upwards
and decelerating, but the Ascent rate is less
than 200m/s. Ascent rate will greater than zero. Vertical
acceleration will be less than zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drogue. The rocket has reached apogee and
is heading back down, but is above the
configured Main altitude. Ascent rate will be less than zero during
this state. Vertical acceleration will be negative until the rocket
reaches a terminal descent rate, at which point Vertical
acceleration will be zero. Both Ascent rate and Vertical
acceleration are very noisy in this state, so be careful when
trying to use them to control pyro channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main. The rocket is still descending, and
is below the Main altitude. Ascent rate will be less than zero
during this state. Vertical acceleration may be briefly less than
zero as the rocket slows from drogue descent to main descent, but
it will settle down to a zero value once the rocket has reached the
terminal velocity under the main chute. Ascent rate and Vertical
acceleration should be much less noisy once the main chute has
deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landed. The rocket is no longer moving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can select a state to limit when the pyro channel may activate;
note that the check is based on when the rocket transitions <strong>into</strong> the
state, and so checking for “greater than Boost” means that the rocket
is currently in boost or some later state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a motor burns out, the rocket enters either Fast or Coast state
(depending on how fast it is moving). If the computer detects upwards
acceleration again, it will move back to Boost state.</p>

heading to a major launch.  If too many people are
all trying to download map data at once, Google may

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a drop-down menu of launch sites we know

run-time, so as new sites are sent in, they&#8217;ll get
automatically added to this list.  If the launch site
isn&#8217;t in the list, you can manually enter the lat/lon
values</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four different kinds of maps you can view;
you can select which to download by selecting as many
as you like from the available types:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Hybrid</dt>
<dd>
<p>A combination of satellite imagery and road data. This

<dt class="hdlist1">Satellite</dt>
<dd>
<p>Just the satellite imagery without any annotation.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Roadmap</dt>
<dd>

features.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Terrain</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contour intervals and shading that show hills and
valleys.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can specify the range of zoom levels to download;
smaller numbers show more area with less
resolution. The default level, 0, shows about
3m/pixel. One zoom level change doubles or halves that
number. Larger zoom levels show more detail, smaller
zoom levels less.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Map Radius value sets how large an area around the
center point to download. Select a value large enough
to cover any plausible flight from that site. Be aware
that loading a large area with a high maximum zoom
level can attempt to download a lot of data. Loading
hybrid maps with a 10km radius at a minimum zoom of -2
and a maximum zoom of 2 consumes about 120MB of
space. Terrain and road maps consume about 1/10 as
much space as satellite or hybrid maps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking the 'Load Map' button will fetch images from
Google Maps; note that Google limits how many images
you can fetch at once, so if you load more than one
launch site, you may get some gray areas in the map
which indicate that Google is tired of sending data to
you. Try again later.</p>

likely that your callsigns are different in some way.</p>

<dd>
<p>This indicates whether there is space remaining

flights, there may not be any space left. TeleMetrum
and TeleMega can store multiple flights, depending on
the configured maximum flight log size. TeleGPS logs
data continuously. TeleMini v1.0 stores only a single

<h2 id="_system_operation">Appendix A: System Operation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_firmware_modes">A.1. Firmware Modes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AltOS firmware build for the altimeters has two
fundamental modes, “idle” and “flight”.  Which of these modes
the firmware operates in is determined at start up
time.
For
TeleMetrum, TeleMega and EasyMega, which have accelerometers, the mode is
controlled by the orientation of the
rocket (well, actually the board, of course&#8230;&#8203;) at the time
power is switched on.  If the rocket is “nose up”, then
the flight computer assumes it&#8217;s on a rail or rod being prepared for
launch, so the firmware chooses flight mode.  However, if the
rocket is more or less horizontal, the firmware instead enters
idle mode.
Since
EasyMini doesn&#8217;t
have an
accelerometer we can use to determine orientation, “idle” mode
is selected if the board is connected via USB to a computer,
otherwise the board enters “flight” mode.
TeleMini
selects “idle” mode if it receives a command packet
within the
first five seconds of operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At power on, the altimeter will beep out the battery voltage
to the nearest tenth of a volt.  Each digit is represented by
a sequence of short “dit” beeps, with a pause between
digits. A zero digit is represented with one long “dah”
beep. Then there will be a short pause while the altimeter
completes initialization and self test, and decides which mode
to enter next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In flight or “pad” mode, the altimeter engages the flight
state machine, goes into transmit-only mode to send telemetry,
and waits for launch to be detected.  Flight mode is indicated
by an “di-dah-dah-dit” (“P” for pad) on the beeper or lights,
followed by beeps or flashes indicating the state of the
pyrotechnic igniter continuity.  One beep/flash indicates
apogee continuity, two beeps/flashes indicate main continuity,
three beeps/flashes indicate both apogee and main continuity,
and one longer “brap” sound which is made by rapidly
alternating between two tones indicates no continuity.  For a
dual deploy flight, make sure you&#8217;re getting three beeps or
flashes before launching!  For apogee-only or motor eject
flights, do what makes sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If idle mode is entered, you will hear an audible “di-dit” or
see two short flashes (“I” for idle), and the flight state
machine is disengaged, thus no ejection charges will fire.
The altimeters also listen for the radio link when in idle
mode for requests sent via TeleDongle.  Commands can be issued
in idle mode over either USB or the radio link
equivalently.
TeleMini only has the radio link.
Idle mode is useful for configuring the altimeter, for
extracting data from the on-board storage chip after
flight, and for ground testing pyro charges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In “Idle” and “Pad” modes, once the mode indication
beeps/flashes and continuity indication has been sent, if
there is no space available to log the flight in on-board
memory, the flight computer will emit a warbling tone (much
slower than the “no continuity tone”)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="#_understanding_beeps">Understanding Beeps</a> for a summary of all of
the audio signals used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once landed, the flight computer will signal that by emitting
the “Landed” sound described above, after which it will beep
out the apogee height (in meters). Each digit is represented
by a sequence of short “dit” beeps, with a pause between
digits. A zero digit is represented with one long “dah”
beep. The flight computer will continue to report landed mode
and beep out the maximum height until turned off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One “neat trick” of particular value when TeleMetrum, TeleMega
or EasyMega are used with
very large air-frames, is that you can power the board up while the
rocket is horizontal, such that it comes up in idle mode.  Then you can
raise the air-frame to launch position, and issue a 'reset' command
via TeleDongle over the radio link to cause the altimeter to reboot and
come up in flight mode.  This is much safer than standing on the top
step of a rickety step-ladder or hanging off the side of a launch
tower with a screw-driver trying to turn on your avionics before
installing igniters!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMini is configured solely via the radio link. Of course, that
means you need to know the TeleMini radio configuration values
or you won&#8217;t be able to communicate with it. For situations
when you don&#8217;t have the radio configuration values,
TeleMini v1.0
offers an 'emergency recovery' mode. In this mode,
TeleMini v1.0 is
configured as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sets the radio frequency to 434.550MHz</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets the radio calibration back to the factory value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets the callsign to N0CALL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not go to 'pad' mode after five seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get into 'emergency recovery' mode, first find the row of
four small holes opposite the switch wiring. Using a short
piece of small gauge wire, connect the outer two holes
together, then power TeleMini up. Once the red LED is lit,
disconnect the wire and the board should signal that it&#8217;s in
'idle' mode after the initial five second startup
period.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_gps">A.2. GPS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMetrum and TeleMega include a complete GPS receiver.  A
complete explanation of how GPS works is beyond the scope of
this manual, but the bottom line is that the GPS receiver
needs to lock onto at least four satellites to obtain a solid
3 dimensional position fix and know what time it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flight computers provide backup power to the GPS chip any time a
battery is connected.  This allows the receiver to “warm start” on
the launch rail much faster than if every power-on were a GPS
“cold start”.  In typical operations, powering up
on the flight line in idle mode while performing final air-frame
preparation will be sufficient to allow the GPS receiver to cold
start and acquire lock.  Then the board can be powered down during
RSO review and installation on a launch rod or rail.  When the board
is turned back on, the GPS system should lock very quickly, typically
long before igniter installation and return to the flight line are
complete.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_controlling_an_altimeter_over_the_radio_link">A.3. Controlling An Altimeter Over The Radio Link</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the unique features of the Altus Metrum system is the
ability to create a two way command link between TeleDongle
and an altimeter using the digital radio transceivers
built into each device. This allows you to interact with the
altimeter from afar, as if it were directly connected to the
computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any operation which can be performed with a flight computer can
either be done with the device directly connected to the
computer via the USB cable, or through the radio
link. TeleMini doesn&#8217;t provide a USB connector and so it is
always communicated with over radio.  Select the appropriate
TeleDongle device when the list of devices is presented and
AltosUI will interact with an altimeter over the radio link.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One oddity in the current interface is how AltosUI selects the
frequency for radio communications. Instead of providing
an interface to specifically configure the frequency, it uses
whatever frequency was most recently selected for the target
TeleDongle device in Monitor Flight mode. If you haven&#8217;t ever
used that mode with the TeleDongle in question, select the
Monitor Flight button from the top level UI, and pick the
appropriate TeleDongle device.  Once the flight monitoring
window is open, select the desired frequency and then close it
down again. All radio communications will now use that frequency.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Save Flight Data—Recover flight data from the
rocket without opening it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure altimeter apogee delays, main deploy
heights and additional pyro event conditions to
respond to changing launch conditions. You can also
'reboot' the altimeter. Use this to remotely enable
the flight computer by turning TeleMetrum or
TeleMega on in “idle” mode, then once the air-frame
is oriented for launch, you can reboot the
altimeter and have it restart in pad mode without
having to climb the scary ladder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire Igniters—Test your deployment charges without snaking
wires out through holes in the air-frame. Simply assemble the
rocket as if for flight with the apogee and main charges
loaded, then remotely command the altimeter to fire the
igniters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operation over the radio link for configuring an
altimeter, ground testing igniters, and so forth uses
the same RF frequencies as flight telemetry.  To
configure the desired TeleDongle frequency, select the
monitor flight tab, then use the frequency selector
and close the window before performing other desired
radio operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flight computers only enable radio commanding in
'idle' mode.  TeleMetrum and TeleMega use the
accelerometer to detect which orientation they start
up in, so make sure you have the flight computer lying
horizontally when you turn it on. Otherwise, it will
start in 'pad' mode ready for flight, and will not be
listening for command packets from TeleDongle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMini listens for a command packet for five seconds
after first being turned on, if it doesn&#8217;t hear
anything, it enters 'pad' mode, ready for flight and
will no longer listen for command packets. The easiest
way to connect to TeleMini is to initiate the command
and select the TeleDongle device. At this point, the
TeleDongle will be attempting to communicate with the
TeleMini. Now turn TeleMini on, and it should
immediately start communicating with the TeleDongle
and the desired operation can be performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can monitor the operation of the radio link by watching the
lights on the devices. The red LED will flash each time a packet
is transmitted, while the green LED will light up on TeleDongle when
it is waiting to receive a packet from the altimeter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ground_testing">A.4. Ground Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important aspect of preparing a rocket using electronic deployment
for flight is ground testing the recovery system.
Thanks
to the bi-directional radio link central to the Altus Metrum system,
this can be accomplished in a TeleMega, TeleMetrum or TeleMini equipped rocket
with less work than you may be accustomed to with other systems.  It
can even be fun!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just prep the rocket for flight, then power up the altimeter
in “idle”
mode (placing air-frame horizontal for TeleMetrum or TeleMega, or
selecting the Configure Altimeter tab for TeleMini).
This will cause
the firmware to go into “idle” mode, in which the normal flight
state machine is disabled and charges will not fire without
manual command.
You can now command the altimeter to fire the apogee
or main charges from a safe distance using your
computer and the Fire Igniter tab to complete ejection testing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_radio_link">A.5. Radio Link</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMetrum, TeleMini and TeleMega all incorporate an
RF transceiver, but it&#8217;s not a full duplex system;
each end can only be transmitting or receiving at any
given moment. So we had to decide how to manage the
link.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By design, the altimeter firmware listens for the
radio link when it&#8217;s in “idle mode”, which allows us
to use the radio link to configure the rocket, do
things like ejection tests, and extract data after a
flight without having to crack open the air-frame.
However, when the board is in “flight mode”, the
altimeter only transmits and doesn&#8217;t listen at all.
That&#8217;s because we want to put ultimate priority on
event detection and getting telemetry out of the
rocket through the radio in case the rocket crashes
and we aren&#8217;t able to extract data later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t generally use a 'normal packet radio' mode
like APRS because they&#8217;re just too inefficient.  The
GFSK modulation we use is FSK with the base-band
pulses passed through a Gaussian filter before they go
into the modulator to limit the transmitted bandwidth.
When combined with forward error correction and
interleaving, this allows us to have a very robust
19.2 kilobit data link with only 10-40 milliwatts of
transmit power, a whip antenna in the rocket, and a
hand-held Yagi on the ground.  We&#8217;ve had flights to
above 21k feet AGL with great reception, and
calculations suggest we should be good to well over
40k feet AGL with a 5-element yagi on the ground with
our 10mW units and over 100k feet AGL with the 40mW
devices.  We hope to fly boards to higher altitudes
over time, and would of course appreciate customer
feedback on performance in higher altitude flights!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_aprs">A.6. APRS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMetrum v2.0 and TeleMega can send APRS if desired, and the
interval between APRS packets can be configured. As each APRS
packet takes a full second to transmit, we recommend an
interval of at least 5 seconds to avoid consuming too much
battery power or radio channel bandwidth. You can configure
the APRS interval using AltosUI; that process is described in
<a href="#_configure_altimeter">Configure Altimeter</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltOS supports both compressed and uncompressed APRS
position report data formats. The compressed format
provides for higher position precision and shorter
packets than the uncompressed APRS format. We&#8217;ve found
some older APRS receivers that do not handle the
compressed format. The Kenwood TH-72A requires the use
of uncompressed format to display altitude information
correctly. The Yaesu FT1D requires the use of
compressed format to display altitude information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APRS packets include an SSID (Secondary Station Identifier)
field that allows one operator to have multiple
transmitters. AltOS allows you to set this to a single digit
from 0 to 9, allowing you to fly multiple transmitters at the
same time while keeping the identify of each one separate in
the receiver. By default, the SSID is set to the last digit of
the device serial number.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The APRS packet format includes a comment field that
can have arbitrary text in it. AltOS uses this to send
status information as shown in the following table.</p>

<p>Configuring an Altus Metrum altimeter for flight is
very simple.  Even on our baro-only TeleMini and
EasyMini boards, the use of a Kalman filter means
there is no need to set a “mach delay”.  All of the
configurable parameters can be set using AltosUI. Read

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Altus Metrum products are sophisticated electronic devices.
When handled gently and properly installed in an air-frame, they
will deliver impressive results.  However, as with all electronic
devices, there are some precautions you must take.</p>

<td class="content">
The Lithium Polymer rechargeable batteries have an
extraordinary power density.  This is great because we can fly with
much less battery mass than if we used alkaline batteries or previous
generation rechargeable batteries&#8230;&#8203; but if they are punctured
or their leads are allowed to short, they can and will release their
energy very rapidly!
Thus we recommend that you take some care when handling our batteries
and consider giving them some extra protection in your air-frame.  We
often wrap them in suitable scraps of closed-cell packing foam before
strapping them down, for example.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The barometric sensors used on all of our flight computers are
sensitive to sunlight.  In normal mounting situations, the baro sensor
and all of the other surface mount components
are “down” towards whatever the underlying mounting surface is, so
this is not normally a problem.  Please consider this when designing an
installation in an air-frame with a see-through plastic payload bay.  It
is particularly important to
consider this with TeleMini v1.0, both because the baro sensor is on the
“top” of the board, and because many model rockets with payload bays
use clear plastic for the payload bay!  Replacing these with an opaque
cardboard tube, painting them, or wrapping them with a layer of masking
tape are all reasonable approaches to keep the sensor out of direct
sunlight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The barometric sensor sampling port must be able to “breathe”,
both by not being covered by foam or tape or other materials that might
directly block the hole on the top of the sensor, and also by having a
suitable static vent to outside air.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with all other rocketry electronics, Altus Metrum altimeters must
be protected from exposure to corrosive motor exhaust and ejection
charge gasses.</p>

<p>The on-board flash is partitioned into separate flight logs,

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuration data is also stored in the flash memory on
TeleMetrum v1.x,
TeleMini v3.0 and

This consumes 64kB

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeleMetrum v2.0, TeleMega and EasyMega
store configuration data in a bit of eeprom available within

more flight data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To compute the amount of space needed for a single flight, you
can multiply the expected ascent time (in seconds) by 100
times bytes-per-sample, multiply the expected descent time (in
seconds) by 10 times the bytes per sample and add the two
together. That will slightly under-estimate the storage (in
bytes) needed for the flight.
For instance, a TeleMetrum v2.0 flight spending
20 seconds in ascent and 150 seconds in descent will take
about (20 * 1600) + (150 * 160) = 56000 bytes of storage. You
could store dozens of these flights in the on-board flash.</p>

<p>Altus Metrum flight computers will not overwrite existing
flight data, so be sure to download flight data and erase it

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version 1.8.1 includes an important bug fix for Apogee Lockout
operation in all flight computers. Anyone using this option
must update firmware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This release also contains a change in how flight computers
with accelerometers deal with speeds around and above Mach
1. In previous versions, the flight computer would completely
disregard the barometric sensor above 330m/s (around Mach
1). Now, the data from the barometric sensor is reduced in
effect without ever going away entirely. This prevents early
drogue deployment for flights which spend considerable time
above Mach 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.8.1 also contains a couple of minor fixes for AltosUI when
analyzing saved data files.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version 1.1.1 is a bug-fix release. It fixes a couple of bugs
in AltosUI and one firmware bug that affects TeleMetrum
version 1.0 boards. Thanks to Bob Brown for help diagnosing
the Google Earth file export issue, and for suggesting the
addition of the Ground Distance value in the Descent tab.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltOS fixes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TeleMetrum v1.0 boards use the AT45DB081D flash
memory part to store flight data, which is different
from later TeleMetrum boards. The AltOS v1.1 driver
for this chip couldn&#8217;t erase memory, leaving it
impossible to delete flight data or update
configuration values. This bug doesn&#8217;t affect newer
TeleMetrum boards, and it doesn&#8217;t affect the safety
of rockets flying version 1.1 firmware.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="_altosui_2">F.27.2. AltosUI</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltosUI new features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “Descent” tab displays the range to the rocket,
which is a combination of the over-the-ground
distance to the rockets current latitude/longitude
and the height of the rocket. As such, it&#8217;s useful
for knowing how far away the rocket is, but
difficult to use when estimating where the rocket
might eventually land. A new “Ground Distance” field
has been added which displays the distance to a spot
right underneath the rocket.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltosUI fixes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a Google Earth file (KML) from on-board
flight data (EEPROM) would generate an empty
file. The code responsible for reading the EEPROM
file wasn&#8217;t ever setting the GPS valid bits, and so
the KML export code thought there was no GPS data in
the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “Landed” tab was displaying all values in metric
units, even when AltosUI was configured to display
imperial units. Somehow I just missed this tab when
doing the units stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensor data wasn&#8217;t being displayed for TeleMini
flight computers in Monitor Idle mode, including
things like battery voltage. The code that picked
which kinds of data to fetch from the flight
computer was missing a check for TeleMini when
deciding whether to fetch the analog sensor data.</p>

<p>Version 1.1 is a minor release. It provides a few new features
in AltosUI and the AltOS firmware and fixes bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_altos_26">F.28.1. AltOS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltOS Firmware New Features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add apogee-lockout value. Overrides the apogee
detection logic to prevent incorrect apogee charge
firing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force the radio frequency to 434.550MHz when the
debug clock pin is connected to ground at boot
time. This provides a way to talk to a TeleMini
which is configured to some unknown frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide RSSI values for Monitor Idle mode. This
makes it easy to check radio range without needing
to go to flight mode.</p>

<p>AltOS Fixes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug where the data reported in telemetry
packets was from 320ms ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug which caused the old received telemetry
packets to be retransmitted over the USB link when
the radio was turned off and back on.</p>

<p>AltosUI New Features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make the look-n-feel configurable, providing a choice from
the available options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an 'Age' element to mark how long since a
telemetry packet has been received. Useful to
quickly gauge whether communications with the rocket
are still active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add 'Configure Ground Station' dialog to set the
radio frequency used by a particular TeleDongle
without having to go through the flight monitor UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add configuration for the new apogee-lockout
value. A menu provides a list of reasonable values,
or the value can be set by hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add Imperial units mode to present data in feet
instead of meters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltosUI Fixes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix a bug that caused GPS ready to happen too
quickly. The software was using every telemetry
packet to signal new GPS data, which caused GPS
ready to be signalled after 10 packets instead of 10
GPS updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix Google Earth data export to work with recent
versions. The google earth file loading code got a
lot pickier, requiring some minor white space
changes in the export code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed how flight data are downloaded. Now there&#8217;s
an initial dialog asking which flights to download,
and after that finishes, a second dialog comes up
asking which flights to delete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-compute time spent in each state for the flight
graph; this figures out the actual boost and landing
times instead of using the conservative values
provide by the flight electronics. This improves the
accuracy of the boost acceleration and main descent
rate computations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make AltosUI run on Mac OS Lion. The default Java
heap space was dramatically reduced for this release
causing much of the UI to fail randomly. This most
often affected the satellite mapping download and
displays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change how data are displayed in the 'table' tab of
the flight monitoring window. This eliminates
entries duplicated from the header and adds both
current altitude and pad altitude, which are useful
in 'Monitor Idle' mode.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.1 is a major release, adding support for the
TeleMini device and lots of new AltosUI features</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_altos_27">F.29.1. AltOS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltOS New Features</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add TeleMini v1.0 support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support operation of TeleMetrum with the antenna pointing
aft. Previous firmware versions required the antenna to be
pointing upwards, now there is a configuration option
allowing the antenna to point aft, to aid installation in
some airframes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to disable telemetry. For airframes where an antenna
just isn&#8217;t possible, or where radio transmissions might
cause trouble with other electronics, there&#8217;s a
configuration option to disable all telemetry. Note that the
board will still enable the radio link in idle mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arbitrary frequency selection. The radios in Altus Metrum
devices can be programmed to a wide range of frequencies, so
instead of limiting devices to 10 pre-selected 'channels',
the new firmware allows the user to choose any frequency in
the 70cm band. Note that the RF matching circuit on the
boards is tuned for around 435MHz, so frequencies far from
that may reduce the available range.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltOS Fixes</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change telemetry to be encoded in multiple 32-byte
packets. This enables support for TeleMini and other devices
without requiring further updates to the TeleDongle
firmware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kalman-filter based flight-tracking. The model based sensor
fusion approach of a Kalman filter means that AltOS now
computes apogee much more accurately than before, generally
within a fraction of a second. In addition, this approach
allows the baro-only TeleMini device to correctly identify
Mach transitions, avoiding the error-prone selection of a
Mach delay.</p>

<p>AltosUI New Features</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add main/apogee voltage graphs to the data
plot. This provides a visual indication if the
igniters fail before being fired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scan for altimeter devices by watching the defined
telemetry frequencies. This avoids the problem of
remembering what frequency a device was configured
to use, which is especially important with TeleMini
which does not include a USB connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor altimeter state in "Idle" mode. This
provides much of the information presented in the
"Pad" dialog from the Monitor Flight command,
monitoring the igniters, battery and GPS status
withing requiring the flight computer to be armed
and ready for flight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-load map images from home. For those launch
sites which don&#8217;t provide free Wi-Fi, this allows
you to download the necessary satellite images
given the location of the launch site. A list of
known launch sites is maintained at altusmetrum.org
which AltosUI downloads to populate a menu; if
you&#8217;ve got a launch site not on that list, please
send the name of it, latitude and longitude along
with a link to the web site of the controlling club
to the altusmetrum mailing list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight statistics are now displayed in the Graph
data window. These include max height/speed/accel,
average descent rates and a few other bits of
information. The Graph Data window can now be
reached from the 'Landed' tab in the Monitor Flight
window so you can immediately see the results of a
flight.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>AltosUI Changes</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>Wait for altimeter when using packet mode. Instead
of quicly timing out when trying to initialize a
packet mode configuration connection, AltosUI now
waits indefinitely for the remote device to appear,
providing a cancel button should the user get
bored. This is necessary as the TeleMini can only be
placed in "Idle" mode if AltosUI is polling it.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for TeleMetrum v1.1 hardware. Sources for the flash
memory part used in v1.0 dried up, so v1.1 uses a different
part which required a new driver and support for explicit
flight log erasing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple flight log support. This stores more than one
flight log in the on-board flash memory. It also requires
the user to explicitly erase flights so that you won&#8217;t lose
flight logs just because you fly the same board twice in one
day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telemetry support for devices with serial number &gt;= 256.
Previous versions used a telemetry packet format that
provided only 8 bits for the device serial number. This
change requires that both ends of the telemetry link be
running the 0.9 firmware or they will not communicate.</p>

<p>Post-flight graphing tool. This lets you explore the
behaviour of your rocket after flight with a scroll-able and
zoom-able chart showing the altitude, speed and acceleration
of the airframe along with events recorded by the flight
computer. You can export graphs to PNG files, or print them
directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real-time moving map which overlays the in-progress flight
on satellite imagery fetched from Google Maps. This lets you
see in pictures where your rocket has landed, allowing you
to plan recovery activities more accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireless recovery system testing. Prep your rocket for
flight and test fire the deployment charges to make sure
things work as expected. All without threading wires through
holes in your airframe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimized flight status displays. Each flight state now has
it&#8217;s own custom 'tab' in the flight monitoring window so you
can focus on the most important details. Pre-flight, the
system shows a set of red/green status indicators for
battery voltage, apogee/main igniter continutity and GPS
reception. Wait until they&#8217;re all green and your rocket is
ready for flight. There are also tabs for ascent, descent
and landing along with the original tabular view of the

<p>Monitor multiple flights simultaneously. If you have more
than one TeleDongle, you can monitor a flight with each one
on the same computer.</p>

<li>
<p>Automatic flight monitoring at startup. Plug TeleDongle into
the machine before starting AltosUI and it will
automatically connect to it and prepare to monitor a flight.</p>

<p>Reprogram Altus Metrum devices. Using an Altus Metrum device
connected via USB, another Altus Metrum device can be
reprogrammed using the supplied programming cable between
the two devices.</p>

<li>
<p>Export Flight data to a comma-separated-values file. This
takes either telemetry or on-board flight data and generates
data suitable for use in external applications. All data is
exported using standard units so that no device-specific
knowledge is needed to handle the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak to you during the flight. Instead of spending the
flight hunched over your laptop looking at the screen, enjoy
the view while the computer tells you what’s going on up
there. During ascent, you hear the current flight state and
altitude information. During descent, you get azimuth,
elevation and range information to try and help you find
your rocket in the air. Once on the ground, the direction
