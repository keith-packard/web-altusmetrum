    Version 1.1 is a minor release. It provides a few new features in AltosUI
    and the AltOS firmware and fixes bugs.
  </p><p>
    AltOS Firmware Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add apogee-lockout value. Overrides the apogee detection logic to
	prevent incorrect apogee charge firing.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix a bug where the data reported in telemetry packets was
	from 320ms ago.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Force the radio frequency to 434.550MHz when the debug clock
	pin is connected to ground at boot time. This provides a way
	to talk to a TeleMini which is configured to some unknown frequency.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Provide RSSI values for Monitor Idle mode. This makes it easy to check radio
	range without needing to go to flight mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix a bug which caused the old received telemetry packets to
	be retransmitted over the USB link when the radio was turned
	off and back on.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    AltosUI Changes
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix a bug that caused GPS ready to happen too quickly. The
	software was using every telemetry packet to signal new GPS
	data, which caused GPS ready to be signalled after 10 packets
	instead of 10 GPS updates.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Fix Google Earth data export to work with recent versions. The
	google earth file loading code got a lot pickier, requiring
	some minor white space changes in the export code.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Make the look-n-feel configurable, providing a choice from
	the available options.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add an 'Age' element to mark how long since a telemetry packet
	has been received. Useful to quickly gauge whether
	communications with the rocket are still active.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add 'Configure Ground Station' dialog to set the radio
	frequency used by a particular TeleDongle without having to go
	through the flight monitor UI.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add configuration for the new apogee-lockout value. A menu provides a list of
	reasonable values, or the value can be set by hand.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Changed how flight data are downloaded. Now there's an initial
	dialog asking which flights to download, and after that
	finishes, a second dialog comes up asking which flights to delete.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Re-compute time spent in each state for the flight graph; this
	figures out the actual boost and landing times instead of
	using the conservative values provide by the flight
	electronics. This improves the accuracy of the boost
	acceleration and main descent rate computations.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Make AltosUI run on Mac OS Lion. The default Java heap space
	was dramatically reduced for this release causing much of the
	UI to fail randomly. This most often affected the satellite
	mapping download and displays.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Change how data are displayed in the 'table' tab of the flight
	monitoring window. This eliminates entries duplicated from the
	header and adds both current altitude and pad altitude, which
	are useful in 'Monitor Idle' mode.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	Add Imperial units mode to present data in feet instead of
	meters.
      </p></li></ul></div><p>
