# AltOS

This is Keith's "operating system" for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).

## Motivation ##

[FreeRTOS](http://freertos.org) turned out to be too heavy for our needs, so
Keith started over from scratch and wrote something that does just what we 
needed.

In addition to the firmware for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum) and 
[TeleDongle](../TeleDongle) boards, the AltOS source tree also includes a
number of utilities useful for monitoring and logging telemetry during flight,
post-processing flight data for analysis, and utilities for updating firmware,
and developing and debugging new functionality.  The first generation of these
utilities were Linux-only, but we are gradually evolving the code to work
across multiple platforms, including Mac and Windows systems.

### Linux ###

If you use [Debian](http://www.debian.org), then a pre-built package for 
32-bit x86 is currently available here:

	wget -O - http://altusmetrum.org/apt/altusmetrum.key | apt-key add -
	wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/altos.list http://altusmetrum.org/apt/altos.list
	apt-get update
	apt-get install altos

If you use some other distribution of Linux, then 
a [Linux package](Altos-Linux.tgz) of our second-generation Java bits that 
should run on any distribution with a modern Java version is also available.

If you'd rather build from source, our source tree includes documentation on 
how to build packages for various
Linux systems such as [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org), and the 
debian/ directory contains all the control
files for building the Debian packages on other architectures or derivatives
such as [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com).

Bdale has also created a theme for 
[GDM](http://projects.gnome.org/gdm/) that he uses on his primary notebook,
and the 
[Simple Login Manager](http://slim.berlios.de/) that he uses on all of his
other machines and which is ideally suited for machines dedicated to AltOS 
ground station use.  It includes a photo of a drag-race between 
nearly-identical rockets
built by Keith and Bdale, that was the first time either of us gave TeleMetrum
complete control of a rocket flight without some other backup!  This theme is 
available in the same repository, to install it just install either gdm or
slim (both already available in Debian), and then do:

	apt-get install altusmetrum-themes

### Mac ###

A [Mac OS X package](Altos-Mac.zip) that is compatible with 
versions 10.5 "Leopard" and later (including 10.6 "Snow Leopard") is now 
available.  

### Windows ###

A [Windows package](Altos-Windows.zip) is now available.
