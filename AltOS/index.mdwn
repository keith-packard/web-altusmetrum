# AltOS

This is Keith's "operating system" for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).

## Motivation ##

[FreeRTOS](http://freertos.org) turned out to be too heavy for our needs, so
Keith started over from scratch and wrote something that does just what we 
needed.

The source available from [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[fw/altos](http://git.gag.com/?p=fw/altos;a=summary).  

Note that actually building these sources requires a modifified version of 
sdcc and a set of helper utilities that we're not publishing since we hope 
to have the important bits accepted upstream shortly.  Watch this space for 
more details soon.
