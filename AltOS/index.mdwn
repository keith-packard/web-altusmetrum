# AltOS

This is Keith's "operating system" for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).

## Motivation ##

[FreeRTOS](http://freertos.org) turned out to be too heavy for our needs, so
Keith started over from scratch and wrote something that does just what we 
needed.

The source is available from [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[fw/altos](http://git.gag.com/?p=fw/altos;a=summary).  

### Linux ###

[Debian](http://www.debian.org) packages for 32-bit x86 are available:

	wget -O - http://altusmetrum.org/apt/altusmetrum.key | apt-key add -
	wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/altos.list http://altusmetrum.org/apt/altos.list
	apt-get update
	apt-get install altos

The source tree includes documentation on how to build packages for other
Linux systems such as [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org), and the control
files for building the Debian packages on other architectures or derivatives
such as [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com).

Bdale has also created a theme for 
[GDM](http://projects.gnome.org/gdm/) that he uses on his primary notebook,
and the 
[Simple Login Manager](http://slim.berlios.de/) that he uses on all of his
other machines and which is ideally suited for machines dedicated to AltOS 
ground station use.  It includes a photo of a drag-race between 
nearly-identical rockets
built by Keith and Bdale, that was the first time either of us gave TeleMetrum
complete control of a rocket flight without some other backup!  This theme is 
available in the same repository, to install it just install either gdm or
slim (both already available in Debian), and then do:

	apt-get install altusmetrum-themes

### Mac ###

A preliminary [Mac OS X package](mac/AltosUI.pkg) that is compatible with 
versions 10.5 "Leopard" and later (including 10.6 "Snow Leopard") is now 
available for testing.  

### Windows ###

Coming soon!
