# Installing AltosUI on Mac OS X

Mac OS X places barriers to running software from outside of the Apple
ecosystem on Apple hardware. Whenever you download softwarae, the
browser tags the application as 'foreign' and that prevents the
operating system from running it.

Here's how you can use xattr(1) to clear the protection setting from
the AltosUI.app after it is installed.

1. Display the application extended attributes:

		$ xattr -l /Applications/AltosUI.app
		 com.apple.quarantine:
		 0181;5a380dfb;Google\x20Chrome.app;6B17C3F9-68D3-4C27-A5EA-7ADADE376ACD

    This shows that the app was downloaded using google chrome. Other
    users' values will be different but the com.apple.quarantine
    prefix will be the same!). If this attribute is present
    AltosUI.app won't be allowed to run.

1. Use the following command to remove the attribute preventing MacOS
    X from running this application:

		$ sudo xattr -c /Applications/AltosUI.app

    This clears the extended attribute in question.  You should now be
    able to run our app!

1. Check to make sure the attribute has been cleared:

		$ xattr -l /Applications/AltosUI.app

NOTE: this has to be run every time one installs a new version!
