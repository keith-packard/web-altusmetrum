# TeleMini

This is a very small, baro-only recording dual-deploy altimeter for 
high power model rocketry with integrated telemetry link.  

## Motivation ##

We'd like to fly smaller rockets really high, which motivates an interest
in both electronic deployment and radio direction finding for post-flight
rocket recovery.

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Recording altimeter for model rocketry
* Supports dual deployment (can fire 2 ejection charges)
* 70cm ham-band transceiver for telemetry downlink
* Barometric pressure sensor good to 45k feet MSL
* Designed to use a single LiPo rechargeable battery
* 1.5 x 0.5 inch board designed to fit inside 18mm airframe coupler tube

### Developer View ###

* Hardware Features

* Software Features
	* Written mostly in C with some 8051 assembler
	* Runs from on-chip flash, uses on-chip RAM, stores flight data to
		upper blocks of on-chip flash
* Tools Used
	* [gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/) for schematic capture and PCB layout
	* [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) compiler and source debugger
* Licenses
	* The hardware is licensed under the [TAPR](http://www.tapr.org) [Open Hardware License](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html)

## Artifacts ##

The design files can be found on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the 
project [hw/telemini](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telemini;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

Initial hardware prototypes are assembled and working.  Firmware is under
development.  We do not yet know what these will cost or when they might go
into production.
