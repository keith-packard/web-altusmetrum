# TeleMini

This is a very small, baro-only recording dual-deploy altimeter for 
model rocketry with integrated telemetry link.  

Version 3.0 is back from fabrication and are ready for sale. Units are
available from the [Garbee and Garbee](http://shop.gag.com) web store.

## Older Versions ##

[Version 1.0](v1.0). Same width (0.5 inches), but doesn't have the
rear two mounting holes so it's a bit shorter (1.5 inches instead of
1.67 inches).

There is a single manual for TeleMini and all other Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

An outline of the board with drill hole locations is available in
[pdf](../Documents/telemini-v3-outline.pdf) format.

The hardware design files can be found on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) 
in the project [hw/telemini](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telemini;a=summary).  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
