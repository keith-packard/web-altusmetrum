# TeleMini Version 1.0 #

This is a very small, baro-only recording dual-deploy altimeter for 
model rocketry with integrated telemetry link.  

Production units are available from the 
[Garbee and Garbee](http://auric.gag.com) web 
store.  TeleMini starter kits are also available from 
[Apogee Components](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Altus_Metrum_telemini.asp).

There is a single manual for TeleMini and all other Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design files can be found on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) 
in the project [hw/telemini](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telemini;a=summary).  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
