# TelePyro

This is an 8-channel pyro expansion board for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).

## Motivation ##

It would be nice to support more than the 2 channels of igniter control
included in the stock [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) design, so that we can
fly more complex projects involving staging, air starts, and backup ejection
charges.

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Small circuit board mounted near [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/)
* Requires rework of [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) to replace onboard igniter
channels with cable providing access to LiPo power and implementing 
I2C protocol.
* Connections for 8 distinct igniter firing channels provided
* Supports use of separate battery for ejection charges

### Developer View ###

* [Microchip 16F886](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en530146) Microcontroller
	* 8k Flash
	* 386 bytes RAM
	* I2C target interface
	* In-circuit programming interface
* Software Features (planned)
	* Written in PIC assembler
	* Runs from on-chip flash, uses on-chip RAM
* Tools Used
	* [gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/) for schematic capture and PCB layout
* Licenses
	* The hardware is licensed under the [TAPR](http://www.tapr.org) [Open Hardware License](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html)
	* The software is licensed [GPL version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

## Problems ##

* Since we didn't anticipate this design, [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) needs
minor rework to interface with this board.

## Artifacts ##

As of 11 April 2009, an incomplete schematic exists, but nothing is 
published yet.
