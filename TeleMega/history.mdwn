### User View ###

* Recording altimeter for high power model rocketry
* Supports dual deployment and 4 additional pyro events.  
  Pyro events are 
  configurable and can be based on time and various flight events and status,
  including angle from vertical (for safety in staging and air start flights).
* 70cm ham-band transceiver for telemetry downlink
* Barometric pressure sensor good to 100k feet MSL
* 1-axis 105-g accelerometer for motor characterization
* 3-axis 16-g accelerometer for gyro calibration
* 3-axis 2000 deg/sec gyros
* 3-axis magnetic sensor
* On-board, integrated GPS receiver
* On-board non-volatile memory for flight data storage
* USB for power, configuration, and data recovery
* Integrated support for LiPo rechargeable batteries
* User choice of pyro battery configuration, can use primary LiPo or any
  customer-chosen separate pyro battery up to 12 volts nominal.
* 3.25 x 1.25 inch board designed to fit inside 38mm airframe coupler tube

## Version 2.0 ##

The only changes between v1 and v2 of TeleMega were that the SOC pin 
assignments for the companion port were adjusted to match improvements made 
during the design of EasyMega, the unused serial port connector was replaced 
with a connector for attaching 4 RC-style servos, and we upgraded from the 
CC1120 to the CC1200 radio part from TI.

TeleMega v2.0 required AltOS version 1.6.2 or later.
