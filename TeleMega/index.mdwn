# TeleMega

This is a high-end recording dual-deploy altimeter for high power model 
rocketry with integrated GPS and telemetry link.  The features included
make TeleMega the ideal choice for complex projects including sustainers
on multi-stage projects.  In particular, pyro events are configurable and 
can be based on time and various flight events and status, including angle 
from vertical.

For the latest TeleMega firmware and related ground station software, please
visit the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.  TeleMega v4.0 requires AltOS
version 1.9.2 or later.

These are photos of production version 1.0 .. maybe someday we'll take photos
of a newer version (?) .. but they look similar:
