## LCA 2011 ##

We hosted a Rockets "miniconf" associated with the Australian national Linux 
Conference held in Brisbane in January 2011.  Bdale and Keith gave
[talks](/talks/) about hobby rocketry and the work that led to development
of [TeleMetrum](/TeleMetrum) at LCA in previous years, but the location of
the conference had never been great for trying to organize a launch adjacent
in time.  Thanks to help from the 
[Queensland Rocketry Society](http://www.qldrocketry.com/), we made it happen
in 2011!
