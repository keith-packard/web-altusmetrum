# MegaDongle

This is an RF interface designed primarily for use as a ground station
interacting with Altus Metrum altimeters on board high power model 
rockets.  Think of it as a USB to RF interface.  The RF filter components 
are set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz.

MegaDongle is intended to supplement and perhaps eventually replace 
[TeleDongle](../TeleDongle) with a product that provides on the order of 
6dB better transmit and receive RF performance, at a modest increase in
manufacturing cost.

For the latest MegaDongle firmware and related software, please

There are no MegaDongle photos to share yet.

## Features ##

### User View ###

## [Production History](../production) ##

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for most Altus Metrum products including MegaDongle,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/megadongle](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/megadongle;a=summary).  

The firmware can be found on the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.

## Future Plans ##

Our version 0.1 design was abandoned after we discovered the need for more
processing power to implement in software the same FEC approach provided
by the CC1111 we used in [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle).

Version 0.2 prototypes are underway.  

No firm schedule for production and sale of MegaDongle has been set yet.
