# TeleShield

This is an RF interface board for use with [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)
systems.  It provides the equivalent of a [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle) 
plus [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com), plus a microSD socket for 
data storage.

The RF filter components are set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz.

These are photos of the first prototype:

## Features ##

### User View ###

* can be used as an 
  [Arduino shield](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoShields) 
  or as a USB peripheral
* 70cm ham-band transceiver compatible with [Altus Metrum](../) products,
  programmed for 38k4 GFSK data rate with forward error correction
* Bluetooth
* micro USB interface
* 4 pin Tyco MicroMaTch connector for debug and flash programming
* 8 pin Tyco MicroMaTch connector supports serial or SPI interface
* micro SD socket for Arduino data storage (not connected to CC1111!)

### Developer View ###

* [TI CC1111F32](http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/cc1111f32.html) Low Power RF System-on-Chip

	* 8051 MCU
	* 32k Flash
	* 4k RAM
	* USB 2.0
	* 6 12-bit analog inputs (11 bits with single-ended sensors)
	* 2 channels of serial I/O
	* digital I/O
	* interfaced to Arduino via async serial plus two handshake pins
* Rayson BTM-182 (Bluetooth SPP module) using async to CC1111
* micro SD card socket interfaced to the Arduino via SPI
* 150mA 3.3V LDO regulator
	* can take input from either USB or the unregulated Arduino input
	* input and output appear on 8-pin companion connector
* Software Features
	* Written mostly in C with some 8051 assembler
	* Runs from on-chip flash, uses on-chip RAM
	* USB serial emulation for data interface
* Tools Used
	* [gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/) for schematic capture and PCB layout
	* [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) compiler and source debugger
* Licenses
	* The hardware is licensed under the [TAPR](http://www.tapr.org) [Open Hardware License](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html)
	* The software is licensed [GPL version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for all Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teleshield](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/teleshield;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

The prototype v0.1 boards work fine.  Feedback from showing them at the
Arduino mini-conference at LCA 2012 resulted in elimination of the Bluetooth
interface.  Updated boards have not been built yet, but 
[schematic and artwork files](v0.2/) are available for review and comment.

No significant interest in this design ever materialized, so we have no plans
to make any more at this time.
