## Artifacts ##

There is a shorter manual for EasyMini which is available in
[html](../AltOS/doc/easymini.html) and
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/easymini.pdf) formats. EasyMini is also documented
in the comprehensive Altus Metrum manual in
[html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats

An outline of the board with drill hole locations is available in
[pdf](../Documents/easymini-outline.pdf) format.

Thanks to Bryan Duke, there's also a 3d model of EasyMini available on 
[Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1946852). 

The hardware design files can be found on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) 
in the project [hw/easymini](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/easymini;a=summary).  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
of the files for production PCB version 1.0 in more easily readable form.

## Older Version ##

Easy Mini [version 1.0](v1.0) was largely the same design but used a
different processor.
