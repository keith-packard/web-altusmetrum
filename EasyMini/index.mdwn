# EasyMini

This is a small, baro-only recording dual-deploy altimeter for 
model rocketry

EasyMini is currently in development, with a handful of prototype
boards built and flown. Production units will eventually be available from the 
[Garbee and Garbee](http://auric.gag.com) web 
store.

For the latest EasyMini firmware and related ground station software, please
