# MicroPeak USB Interface #

The MicroPeak USB Interface board provides a way to capture
[MicroPeak](../MicroPeak/) flight logs over a USB connection to a
computer running Linux, Mac OS or Windows.

## MicroPeak Data ##

 * Stored in on-chip 512B eeprom
 * Records raw barometer readings every 192ms
 * Enough storage for 48 seconds

No changes are needed to the [MicroPeak](../MicroPeak/) hardware, but new firmware that
includes the data download feature is necessary to use the MicroPeak
USB Interface.

## MicroPeak Interface ##

[MicroPeak](../MicroPeak/) transmits the entire flight log via the LED just after
reporting the last flight altitude at power up. The data burst is
transmitted in a simple serial format at 9600 baud.

The MicroPeak USB Interface board contains a phototransistor,
op-amp and serial-to-USB interface chip. It also includes a blue LED
which blinks in time with the [MicroPeak](../MicroPeak/) orange LED. This makes
aligning the two boards by hand quite easy.

Here's a picture of the device in operation, with
[MicroPeak](../MicroPeak) positioned to transmit data. The blue LED on
the interface board is visible through the smaller hole in the front
of the box.

## MicroPeak Application ##

The MicroPeak application written in Java runs on
Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  It captures and saves the flight data, then
produces plots and statistics. More information is available on the main
[MicroPeak](../MicroPeak/) page.
