# MicroPeak USB Interface #

The MicroPeak USB Interface board provides a way to capture flight
logs over a USB connection to a computer running Linux, Mac OS or
Windows.

## MicroPeak Data ##

 * Stored in on-chip 512B eeprom
 * Records raw barometer readings every 192ms
 * Enough storage for 48 seconds

No changes are needed to the MicroPeak hardware, but new firmware that
includes the data download feature is necessary to use the MicroPeak
USB Interface.

## MicroPeak Interface ##

MicroPeak transmits the entire flight log via the LED just after
reporting the last flight altitude at power up. The data are
transmitted in regular serial format at 9600 baud.

The MicroPeak USB Interface board contains a phototransistor,
op-amp and serial-to-USB interface chip. It also includes a blue LED
which blinks in time with the MicroPeak orange LED. This makes
aligning the two boards by hand quite easy.

## MicroPeak Application ##

Java application that runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Windows.
Captures and saves data, provides plots and statistics.
