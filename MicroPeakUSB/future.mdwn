# MicroPeak USB Interface Future Version

## v3.0 ##

This version is still in development. It operates exactly like the
v2.0 devices, having a small hole in the top into which you place the
MicroPeak LED. The only difference is that it is enclosed in a smaller
package that looks like a USB thumb drive. It won't need a USB cable
and will plug directly into a computer.
