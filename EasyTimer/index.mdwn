# EasyTimer

This board provides two programmable timer-based pyro channels with tilt
limits.  

The IMU used is the same as on TeleMega and EasyMega, allowing acceleration 
based launch detection, and gyro-based tilt limiting.  This means it's 
possible to configure a pyro event for some amount of time after launch,
or after motor burnout, etc, with the possibility of locking out each event
if the rocket is tilted too far away from vertical.

For projects that require staging or air starts, EasyTimer is a low-cost 
alternative to use of our more expensive products, while retaining the safety 
aspects of tilt-limiting.

There is no EasyTimer firmware yet, but it will be part of the 
[AltOS](../AltOS) suite eventually.

Prototypes of v1 are underway.  This design is not yet for sale.
