This is the site where 
<a href="http://www.gag.com/~bdale">Bdale Garbee </a>
and friends document work on open hardware and software designs for
high powered model rocketry avionics solutions.
Please consider everything here work perpetually in process!

# Hobby Rocketry #

The motivation for the circuits and software you will find on this site is
our loosely-knit group's shared interest in hobby rocketry.  
Rather than try to introduce the hobby to you here, we note that John Coker 
has published an excellent 
[overview of hobby rocketry](http://www.jcrocket.com/welcome.shtml) 
on his web site.  
<p>
To find more information about the rockets Bdale and his son have built, see
[Garbee Rockets](http://www.gag.com/rockets).
<p>
As Bdale and Robert became more experienced in the hobby and started to build
and fly more sophisticated projects, we started to feel limited by the 
existing electronics products available.  AltusMetrum was Bdale's first 
attempt to address this situation with a completely open hardware and software
design... other project have since followed!

# Projects #

* [AltusMetrum](AltusMetrum/)
was Bdale's original project here, a dual-deploy rocketry altimeter.  One 
prototype was built, but never flown.  This project is now indefinitely on hold.

* [TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/) 
is our current project, a dual-deploy rocketry altimeter with improved sensor 
complement and bidirectional RF telemetry link.

# Getting Involved #

If you aren't already playing with model rockets, that's a good place to 
start.  Finding a local [NAR Section](http://nar.org/NARsect.html) or
[Tripoli](http://tripoli.org) Prefecture is a good idea, since you can
learn a lot and see some great flights by showing up at a club launch.

As we make progress, you can read about it in our [News](News/) feed.
We also have an IRC channel #altusmetrum on irc.oftc.net if you have
questions that aren't answered here.
