# Where to Buy #

All Altus Metrum products are available from the 
[Garbee and Garbee](http://auric.gag.com) web 
store.  Additionally, starter kits are available from our distributors, 
including [Apogee Components](http://www.apogeerockets.com),
[Australian Rocketry](http://www.ausrocketry.com), and 
[Aerospace Education](http://www.rockets.co.nz) in New Zealand.

# Products #

These products are all available for purchase:

* [TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/) 
is our flagship product, a dual-deploy rocketry altimeter with
GPS and bidirectional RF telemetry link.

* [TeleMini](TeleMini/)
is a smaller dual-deploy rocketry altimeter with telemetry using only a 
barometric pressure sensor

* [TeleDongle](TeleDongle/) 
is a simple RF interface for use in ground stations interacting with rockets
using [TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/).  It may also be useful as a generic RF
interface for other microcontroller systems.

* [LipoCharger](LipoCharger/) 
is a standalone battery charger for the Lithium Polymer batteries used in
Altus Metrum products.

* [MicroPeak](MicroPeak/)
is a rocket altimeter that is both precise and tiny, designed to be the 
ideal altimeter for model rocket contests.

# Projects #

These are projects we're working on that may become products someday:

* [AltOS](AltOS/) 
is the name of the firmware and related utilities that Keith maintains for
the set of hardware projects here.

* [MegaDongle](MegaDongle/)
is a higher-performance alternative to [TeleDongle](TeleDongle/).

* [MegaMetrum](MegaMetrum/)
is a high-end flight computer with 6 pyro channels, more and better sensors,
GPS, and a high performance bidirectional RF telemetry link.

* [OpenAlt](OpenAlt/)
was Bdale's original project here, a dual-deploy rocketry altimeter.  One 
prototype was built, but never flown.  This project is now indefinitely on hold.

* [TeleBT](TeleBT) is a variation on [TeleDongle](TeleDongle/) that adds
[Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com) as an alternative to USB.

* [TeleNano](TeleNano/)
is a tiny rocketry altimeter with telemetry using only a barometric 
pressure sensor

* [TelePyro](TelePyro/) is a companion board for [TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/)
that adds 8 additional pyro channels.

* [TeleScience](TeleScience/) is a companion board for 
[TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/) that adds 12 channels of thermistor or generic
analog sensor input, and 5 general purpose I/O lines.

* [TeleShield](TeleShield/) is an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) radio shield.

* [TeleTerra](TeleTerra) is a hand-held ground station for use with 
[TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/) and [TeleMini](TeleMini/).

# Hobby Rocketry #

The motivation for the circuits and software you will find on this site is
our loosely-knit group's shared interest in hobby rocketry.  This very brief
[Ted presentation by Steve Jurvetson](http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_jurvetson_on_model_rocketry.html)
quickly conveys at least part of why we do this.  John Coker 
has published an excellent 
[overview of hobby rocketry](http://www.jcrocket.com/welcome.shtml) 
on his web site.  Keith has also put together some useful notes about the 
process of [certification](http://keithp.com/rockets/certification/) to
fly high power rockets.
<p>
To find more information about the rockets Bdale and his son have built, see
[Garbee Rockets](http://www.gag.com/rockets).
<p>
As Bdale and Robert became more experienced in the hobby and started to build
and fly more sophisticated projects, we started to feel limited by the 
existing electronics products available.  OpenAlt was Bdale's first 
attempt to address this situation with a completely open hardware and software
design... other project have since followed, and it's cool to have help from
Keith and other friends!

# Getting Involved #

If you aren't already playing with model rockets, that's a good place to 
start.  Finding a local [NAR Section](http://nar.org/NARsect.html) or
[Tripoli](http://tripoli.org) Prefecture is a good idea, since you can
learn a lot and see some great flights by showing up at a club launch.

As we make progress, you can read about it in our [News](News) feed.  Feel
free to subscribe to our 
[mailing list](http://lists.gag.com/mailman/listinfo/altusmetrum).  We also 
hang out on IRC channel #altusmetrum on irc.oftc.net if you have
questions that aren't answered here.  You can also find us on 
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=341167482968)
and on
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/109995815990298399569).

Our main projects include radio links.  If you don't already have one, 
getting an [Amateur Radio](./Radio) license would be a good thing to do!

And if you just can't wait to show your support for our efforts, visit
our [Cafe Press Logo Shop](http://cafepress.com/altusmetrum) or our
[Printfection Logo Shop](http://printfection.com/altusmetrum) (we're trying
to decide which is better, comments welcome!) and buy a t-shirt or sticker!
