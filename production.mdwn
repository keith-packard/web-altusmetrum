# Altus Metrum Units Constructed

This page contains Bdale's notes about each unit of [TeleMetrum](TeleMetrum/) 
and [TeleDongle](TeleDongle/) assembled to date.

## sn 1 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 to be SPI memory 
chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 56k, 10k tacked from each to 
ground.  R17 replaced with short circuit, R18 removed.

Installed in Bdale's Vertical Assault.  First unit to be flown on 
2009.04.19, on a Cesaroni J335.

Successfully flew Bdale's rebuilt Horizon dual-deploy at Hudson Ranch on
2009.07.18 with a MAWD as backup.  The first dual-deploy flight with a TM
board in control of ejection charges!

## sn 2 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 to be SPI memory 
chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 56k, 10k tacked from each to 
ground.

Delivered to Keith Packard for firmware development and use.  Flown twice
on 10 May 2008 in Keith's Grappler to about 45m on Estes D12-3 motors.

Flew in Keith's Little Dog Dual Deploy at Mile High Mayhem as a payload.  The
ascent was pretty but the rocket failed to deploy and lawn-darted.  The battery
and screw terminal block connectors got more or less torn off, but the rest
of the board survived and good data was recovered from the flight.

Repaired by Bdale, sent back to Keith on 7 July 2009.  Keith reported the
baro sensor as flakey, it was replaced in October 2009 prior to 
NCR Octoberfest.

## sn 3 ##

Full load of v0.1 PCB on 2009.04.22, two cuts and jumps to rewire P1_2 
to be SPI memory chip select, R14 and R15 loaded with 100k, 27k tacked 
from each to ground.

Installed in Bdale's Vertical Assault after sn 1 moved to Horizon, but never
flown there.

Pulled and given to Keith to take home from Mayhem.

Lost in Keith's Nike which was lost for a while after an apparently nominal 
flight in June 2009 at Brothers, Oregon.  Rocket was later found and this unit
is reportedly still in good condition.

## sn 4 ##

from each to ground.

Installed in Robert's Lil Nuke.

Lost at Hudson Ranch 2009.07.18 when we forgot to tape the nose cone on and
both it and the electronics sled came out at apogee and were not recovered.

## sn 5 ##

Modified 2009.11.20 to:

* use TC1055-3.3VCT713 100ma regulator proposed for v0.2
* route 3.3V instead of v_lipo to the serial connector for SkyTraq GPS
* use v_lipo for pyro voltage instead of 5V with 1000uF capacitor
* added 100uF 1206 capacitor on 3.3V rail

In this configuration, flew two textbook perfect flights on 2009.11.21 at
Hudson Ranch in Trick-O-Treat on J motors.

Modified 2011.11.13 to:

* test ADXL78 accelerometer functionality for v1.2 build
* use 3.3k instead of 10k for R2 and R3, to eliminate power-on pyro glitching
