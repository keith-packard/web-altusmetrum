# Future TeleLaunch Products #

## TeleLCOTwo ##

<img src="protos/telelcotwo.jpg">

A small LCO unit capable of handling up to two pyro channels.  TeleLCOTwo 
is ideal for individuals, or clubs that have an existing launch control 
system but want to use TeleLaunch for an "away" launch cell.  

TeleLCOTwo is configured in advance by USB to know which two pyro channels 
it should interact with, and then a simple rocker switch selects between 
the two during use.

TeleLCOTwo comes packaged in a weather-sealed polycarbonate box with 
switches on one face, and BNC antenna connector and USB connectors 
through the box walls.  It can be placed on a table, but is typically 
hand-held during operation.

The TeleLCOTwo hardware design is available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telelcotwo](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telelcotwo;a=summary).  

## TeleFireTwo ##

<img src="protos/telefireone.jpg">

TeleFireTwo is a pyro board supporting two igniter circuits.  This 
makes TeleFireTwo ideal for individuals, launch trailers, or for "away 
cells" at larger club launches.  

All high-current connections are made on the board using standard 
1/4-inch spade lugs, with screw terminals for the siren and strobe.  This 
allows for easy packaging and quick board swaps.

The photo above is of an early single-channel prototype, the design has 
changed significantly since then and we'll take new photos someday. The two 
switches are for power on/off and safe/arm.  The two cables are for DC power 
in and igniter leads out. 

The TeleFireOne hardware design is available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telefiretwo](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telefiretwo;a=summary).  

## Availability ##

Prototypes of these products have been built, deployed, and used 
successfully.  Updates to the designs are underway and we hope to
introduce them sometime in 2019.
