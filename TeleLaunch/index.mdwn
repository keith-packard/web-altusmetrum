# TeleLaunch — Multi-channel Wireless Launch Controller System #

TeleLaunch is secure radio-controlled rocket launch system capable of
operating up to 400 pads from a single controler. TeleLaunch consists
of two pieces, TeleLCO and TeleFire.

## TeleLCO ##

TeleLCO controls up to 100 TeleFire boxes and is powered by a
rechargable lithium polymer

 * USB connection to charge battery.

 * Large 1.36 inch LCD display for selected pad

 * Rotary knobs for pad selection

 * LED indicators for remote arming, continuity and RF quality

 * Arming switch and firing button

## TeleFire ##

TeleFire has four igniter circuits, each of which uses a 70A
automotive relay to provide a low resistance path, high-current from
the power source to the igniter leads. TeleFire can be powered by any
10-15V supply, from 3-cell lithium polymer packs used in RC aircraft
to a 12V lead acid battery.

 * Continuity Detection. Igniter continuity uses a low-current sensing
   system which sends only 100µA through the igniter to prevent false
   ignition. The circuit also detects a shorted relay.

 * Local LED continuity, arming and RF quality indicators.

 * Strobe and Siren. TeleFire has two 12V medium current (5A) outputs
   to drive a siren and strobe light when the launch system is armed
   and ready to fire.

 * Local arming switch. A positive power switch shutting off the
   igniters and relays prevents the LCO from engaging the firing
   circuit.

## Radio Communications ##

TeleLaunch uses a two-way digital radio communications system for
positive indication of all operations. The communications link is
secured with AES CBC-MAC to prevent accidental or intentional
operation from unauthorized transmitters.

TeleLaunch operates in the 70cm amateur band at 10mW to avoid
interference with any rocketry electronics.
