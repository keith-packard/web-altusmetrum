# TeleLaunch — Multi-channel Wireless Launch Controller System #

TeleLaunch is secure radio-controlled rocket launch system capable of
operating up to 792 pads from a single controler.  A typical TeleLaunch 
system consists of one LCO unit and one or more pyro units.

TeleLaunch uses a two-way digital radio communications system for
positive indication of all operations. The communications link is
secured with AES CBC-MAC to prevent accidental or intentional
operation from unauthorized transmitters.

TeleLaunch operates in the 70cm amateur band at low power using 
Altus Metrum's proven modulation and coding schem to avoid interference 
with any rocketry electronics or other communication devices.

All boards in the TeleLaunch system are easily configured using USB for
parameters like operating frequency, callsign, cryptographic key, and
in the case of pyro units the designated bank number.

## Launch Control Products ##

All launch control units in the TeleLaunch system are designed to use
a lithium polymer battery that can be recharged over USB.  They support 
distinct arm and fire switches, continuous indication of igniter 
continuity, and have super-bright LED indicators for remote arming, 
continuity, and RF link quality plus an audible indication of arming.  

### TeleLCO ###

<a href="telelco-v2.0/lco-open.png"> <img src="telelco-v2.0/lco-open-small.png"></a>

TeleLCO controls up to 99 TeleFire banks, comes packaged in a rugged 
case, and is typically placed on a table for use by the designated LCO.

 * Large 1.36 inch LCD display for selected bank and pad

 * Rotary knob for pad selection

 * Packaged in [Pelican 1170 orange box](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/protector/1170)

Drag races are supported with a separate normal/drag mode selection switch, 
drag mode LED, and select pushbutton.  Channels that are included in the 
current drag race selection have blinking continuity indicators.

The TeleLCO hardware design is available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telelco](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telelco;a=summary).  

### TeleLCOTwo ###

<img src="protos/telelcotwo.jpg">

A small LCO unit capable of handling up to two pyro channels.  TeleLCOTwo 
is ideal for individuals, or clubs that have an existing launch control 
system but want to use TeleLaunch for an "away" launch cell.  

TeleLCOTwo is configured in advance by USB to know which two pyro channels 
it should interact with, and then a simple rocker switch selects between 
the two during use.

TeleLCOTwo comes packaged in a weather-sealed polycarbonate box with 
switches on one face, and BNC antenna connector and USB connectors 
through the box walls.  It can be placed on a table, but is typically 
hand-held during operation.

The TeleLCOTwo hardware design is available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telelcotwo](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telelcotwo;a=summary).  

## Pyro Boards ##

Each pyro board in the TeleLaunch system uses FET technology for lowest 
possible resistance paths, allowing maximum current to be reliably 
delivered from the power source to the igniter leads. TeleFire boards can 
be powered by any 10-15V supply.  This would typically be a 12V lead acid 
battery, but 3-cell lithium polymer packs used in RC aircraft are also
suitable.

Each board features:

 * Continuity Detection. Igniter continuity uses a low-current sensing
   system which sends only 100µA through the igniter to prevent false
   ignition. 

 * Super-bright LEDs for continuity, arming and RF quality indicators.

 * Strobe and Siren. TeleFireFour has two 12V medium current (5A) outputs
   to drive a siren and strobe light when the launch system is armed
   and ready to fire.

 * Local arming switch. When in the safe position, power is completely
   disconnected from the igniter circuits to prevent any possibility
   of the LCO accidentally engaging firing circuits during rocket 
   preparations at the pad.

 * Each board is designed to fit in a standard Hammond weather-sealed
   polycarbonate enclosure with weather-sealed rocker switches for
   power and arming plus cable glands for DC input cable and igniter 
   output cables.  Alternatively, boards can be configured to mount
   in the user's choice of enclosure, such as a metal ammo box or 
   larger NEMA enclosure with space for the user's choice of 
   external connectors.

### TeleFireTwo ###

<img src="protos/telefireone.jpg">

TeleFireTwo is a pyro board supporting two igniter circuits.  This 
makes TeleFireTwo ideal for individuals, launch trailers, or for "away 
cells" at larger club launches.  

All high-current connections are made on the board using standard 
1/4-inch spade lugs, with screw terminals for the siren and strobe.  This 
allows for easy packaging and quick board swaps.

The photo above is of an early single-channel prototype, the design has 
changed significantly since then and we'll take new photos someday. The two 
switches are for power on/off and safe/arm.  The two cables are for DC power 
in and igniter leads out. 

The TeleFireOne hardware design is available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telefiretwo](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telefiretwo;a=summary).  

### TeleFireEight ###

<a href="telefireeight-v2/tf8-overview.png"> <img src="telefireeight-v2/tf8-overview-small.png"></a>

TeleFireEight has eight igniter circuits, making it ideal for use at
club launches.  Larger clubs or launch site setups can use multiple
boards to organize the site into multiple banks with up to 8 rockets
each.

For ease of use and quick reconfiguration, a simple DIP switch on the board 
inside the ammo box is used to select any of the first 8 banks, which is more
than sufficient for most club needs.  If all switches are off, the bank 
number up to 99 configured over USB will be used instead.

The above photo shows a fully packaged early production version, with integral
12 Ah sealed lead acid battery.  There are another four pyro outlets on the
other side of the box, making the design ideal for placing in the middle of
an 8-rail bank.

The TeleFireEight hardware design is available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telefireeight](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telefireeight;a=summary).  

## Documentation ##

There's a cheat-sheat inside the lid of TeleLCO that has proven to be
completely sufficient for our prototype users to figure out and use the 
system.

A complete manual for the TeleLaunch system is available in 
[html](../AltOS/doc/telelaunch.html) and [pdf](../AltOS/doc/telelaunch.pdf) 
formats.

## Software ##

TeleLaunch firmware is part of the larger [AltOS](/AltOS) suite of 
software.  For now, configuration of frequencies, callsigns, and crypto
keys requires a laptop with terminal emulator and a USB cable, but we are
likely to produce an easier to use configuration program eventually.

## Availability ##

TeleLCO and TeleFireEight are now in production, and available for purchase
directly through the [Garbee and Garbee](https://shop.gag.com) online store.

Prototypes of the other products in this family have been built, deployed,
and used successfully.  Updates to the designs are underway and we hope to
have additional products available in 2019.
