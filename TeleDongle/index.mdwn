# TeleDongle

This is an RF interface designed primarily for use as a ground station
interacting with a [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) altimeter on board a high 
power model rocket.  The primary computer interface is USB, but async serial
and SPI are also available as alternatives.  The RF filter components are
by default set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz, but can be altered to
support other frequency ranges.

## [Production History](../production) ##

## Artifacts ##

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teledongle](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/teledongle;a=summary).  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
of files in more easily readable form.

* [pcb artwork](v0.2/teledongle.pcb.pdf)
* [bill of materials](v0.2/partslist.csv)

This board is an integral part of a [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) system, and
the firmware for both share common elements.  More details, including full 
source code and pre-built packages can be found on the 
[AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.

## Future Plans ##

An initial batch of TeleDongle v0.2 boards are currently at our assembler.  If
they work as expected, we hope to have TeleDongle for sale in early March 2010.
