# TeleDongle

This is an RF interface designed primarily for use as a ground station
interacting with Altus Metrum flight computers and trackers on board high 
power model rockets.  The computer interface is USB.  RF filter components are
by default set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz, but can be altered to
support other frequency ranges.

TeleDongle is now at version v3.0, with 5+ dB better receiver sensitivity
than our previous models!

For the latest TeleDongle firmware and related software, please

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for most Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teledongle](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/teledongle;a=summary).  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
of files in more easily readable form.

## Future Plans ##

None!  We're very happy with the TeleDongle v3.0 design.
