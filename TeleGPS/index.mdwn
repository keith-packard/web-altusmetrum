# TeleGPS

This is a GPS-based position tracker and logger.  It uses the same GPS
receiver and similar radio to our flight computers, but does not include
pyro circuits.  This allows the board to be small and light, so that it will
fit well anywhere you need a good GPS tracker.

For the latest TeleGPS firmware and related ground station software, please
visit the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.

## Documentation ##

The manual for TeleGPS is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/telegps.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/telegps.pdf) formats.

## Software ##

The TeleGPS application runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It's written 
in [Java](http://java.com) and offers the
same functionality and interface on all three platforms. It uses the
FTDI USB Serial drivers to communicate with the hardware. If you're
running Mac OS X or Windows, a compatible version of those drivers is
included with the software. You can also install a different from from
the [FTDI Driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) page.

TeleGPS is part of the larger [AltOS](/AltOS) suite of software, which also
includes a dedicated [MicroPeak](/MicroPeak) application.
