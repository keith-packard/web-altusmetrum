# TeleGPS

This is a GPS-based position tracker and logger.  It uses the same GPS
receiver and radio as our flight computers, but does not include pyro 
circuits.  This allows the board to be small and light so that it will
fit well anywhere you need a good GPS tracker.

TeleGPS firmware and related ground station software is part of the 
[AltOS](../AltOS) software suite on this site.  A stripped-down ground 
station program specifically for use with TeleGPS is documented below.

These are photos of production version 1.0, which is substantially similar
visually to the current production version.

## Documentation ##

The manual for TeleGPS is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/telegps.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/telegps.pdf) formats.

## Software ##

The TeleGPS application runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It's written 
in [Java](http://java.com) and offers the
same functionality and interface on all three platforms. It uses the
FTDI USB Serial drivers to communicate with the hardware. If you're
running Mac OS X or Windows, a compatible version of those drivers is
included with the software. You can also install a different from from
the [FTDI Driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) page.

TeleGPS is part of the larger [AltOS](/AltOS) suite of software, which also
includes a dedicated [MicroPeak](/MicroPeak) application.

There is a single manual for TeleGPS and all other Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The current hardware design files are available from
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/telegps](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telegps;a=summary).
