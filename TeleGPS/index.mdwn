# TeleGPS

This is a GPS-based position tracker and logger.  It uses the same GPS
receiver and similar radio to our flight computers, but does not include
pyro circuits.  This allows the board to be small and light, so that it will
fit well anywhere you need a good GPS tracker.

For the latest TeleGPS firmware and related ground station software, please
