# Removing a LiPo Protection Board #

As we have documented 
[elsewhere](http://gag.com/bdale/blog/posts/Batteries_and_Pyro_Circuits.html),
the protection circuit boards included in many LiPo batteries such as the
ones we sold up until April of 2013 can often do more harm than good in 
rocket applications.  This document explains how to remove the protection
circuit board entirely, should you choose to tackle this on your own.

Please note that LiPo batteries have a very low source impedance, which means
they can deliver massive amounts of current if you short the terminals.  We
don't mean to scare anyone familiar with electronic soldering away from this
job, but please be careful, wear eye protection, and have a fire extinguisher 
nearby while performing this work "just in case".

## Getting Started ##

This is what our 850mAh and 110mAh cells look like from the factory:
