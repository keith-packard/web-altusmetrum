# Removing a LiPo Protection Board #

As we have documented 
[elsewhere](http://gag.com/bdale/blog/posts/Batteries_and_Pyro_Circuits.html),
the protection circuit boards included in many LiPo batteries such as the
ones we sold up until April of 2013 can often do more harm than good in 
rocket applications.  This document explains how to remove the protection
circuit board entirely, should you choose to tackle this on your own.

Please note that LiPo batteries have a very low source impedance, which means
they can deliver massive amounts of current if you short the terminals.  We
don't mean to scare anyone familiar with electronic soldering away from this
job, but please be careful, wear eye protection, and have a fire extinguisher 
nearby while performing this work "just in case".

## Getting Started ##

This is what our 850mAh and 110mAh cells look like from the factory:

## Unwrapping ##

The first thing we need to do is remove the tape that covers and protects
the circuit board and associated connections to the wire leads and battery
terminal tabs.  On some batteries, like the 850mAh cell shown here, there is
just a single wrap of translucent yellow/gold Kapton tape to peel.  On some
like the 110mAh cell shown next, there is a layer of Kapton tape over a 
layer of a spongier insulating material.  Preserving the spongy insulating
material is good, so try not to tear it off as you're peeling it up:
