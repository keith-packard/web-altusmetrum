# Misc Documents #

These documents are either authored by Altus Metrum but explain things that 
are outside of the scope of our normal product documentation, or are documents
we have collected that we think provide useful reference information for our
friends and customers.  We hope these documents will be of assistance to 
others, but as in all things related to hobby rocketry, please remember to 
think before you act!
