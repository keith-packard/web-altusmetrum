# TeleScience

This is an expansion board for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) intended to 
support science projects.  It provides 12 analog inputs with selectable
thermistor support, and 5 general purpose I/O pins.  This board can also
be used standalone as a USB I/O device.

## Motivation ##

Bdale's son Robert is interested in mapping the temperatures experienced
by nose cones and fins in flights beyond Mach 1, and we're working with 
our good friend Jeff Lane from 
[Shockwave Rocketry](http://www.shockwaverocketry.com/) 
to instrument one or more of his nose cones in pursuit of that goal.  And
it's easy for us to imagine other experiments that would be facilitated by 
having generic analog data inputs and a few control lines.

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Small circuit board mounted near [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/)
* Requires [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) v0.2 or later, as v0.1 does not 
  have the required companion board interface
* 12 analog input channels, each of which can independently be configured
  for an NTC thermistor or generic 0-3.3 volt analog input.
* 5 general purpose I/O lines
* On-board flash memory for data logging.
* USB interface for programming and development

## Artifacts ##

A schematic and PC board design exist on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) 
in the project 
[hw/telescience](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telescience;a=summary), 
but no prototypes have been built yet.

## Future Plans ##

6 prototypes have been built, of which 2 were installed in 
[2YikStik](http://www.gag.com/rockets/airframes/2YikStik/) 
and flown at LDRS 30 in early September 2011.  Unfortunately, we experienced a 
mechanical failure in the airframe before going fast enough to get exciting
data, but post-flight analysis suggested the TeleScience boards were working
fine up until "the incident".  A replacement airframe 
[YikStik3](http://www.gag.com/rockets/airframes/YikStik3/) 
flew successfully at Airfest 18 in September 2012.  We appear to have good data
from the fin can, but not from the nose cone... more details once the data
analysis is complete.

The thermistor conditioning circuits in the v0.1 design are too tightly coupled 
to the particular model of EPCOS thermistor that we chose for 2YikStik and
YikStik3.  A major revision of the board is nearing prototype stage in Septmeber
2012, and will be further documented here soon.
