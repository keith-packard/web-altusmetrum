# TeleScience History

## v0.1 ##

This is a photo of our original TeleScience board with 12 analog inputs, 
all of which could be used for thermistors... and 5 general-purpose I/O 
pins.  This board could also be used standalone as a USB I/O device.

### Motivation ###

Bdale's son Robert got interested in mapping the temperatures experienced
by nose cones and fins in flights beyond Mach 1, and we started working with 
our good friend Jeff Lane from 
[Shockwave Rocketry](http://www.shockwaverocketry.com/) 
to instrument one or more of his nose cones in pursuit of that goal.  

6 v0.1 prototypes were built, of which 2 were installed in
[2YikStik](http://www.gag.com/rockets/airframes/2YikStik/)
and flown at LDRS 30 in early September 2011.  Unfortunately, we experienced a
mechanical failure in the airframe before going fast enough to get exciting
data, but post-flight analysis suggested the TeleScience boards were working
fine up until "the incident".  A replacement airframe
[YikStik3](http://www.gag.com/rockets/airframes/YikStik3/)
flew successfully at Airfest 18 in September 2012. 

From the beginning, it was easy for us to imagine other experiments that 
would be facilitated by 
having generic analog data inputs and a few control lines.  But experience
using the v0.1 boards made it clear that we'd designed something that was
"too specific" to the primary objective of measuring temperature rises on
a high-speed airframe.  This is why v0.1 has been abandoned in favor of a
significantly re-designed v0.2.

### Features ###

#### User View ####

* Small circuit board mounted near [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/)
* Requires [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) v0.2 or later, as v0.1 does not 
  have the required companion board interface
