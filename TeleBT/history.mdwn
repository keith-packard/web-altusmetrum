# TeleBT History

## Version 1 ##

The v1 product was based on the same TI RF system on chip part that many of
our other early products used.  As a result, it required pair programming 
(meaning you could not update the firmware over USB).  That radio was also
lower transmit power, and had less receiver sensitivity than the ones used 
in our current products.

These are photos of the first production version, 1.0:

## Version 3 ##

For version 3, we moved to an ARM system on chip and discrete radio chip, 
which gave the ability to re-flash over USB and better UHF radio performance,
but we continued to use the same Bluetooth module.
