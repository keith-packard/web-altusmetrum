# TeleBT

TeleBT provides the equivalent of a [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle), with
the addition of [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com) as an alternative to
USB for connection to the ground station computer.

The RF filter components are set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz.

These are photos of prototype version 0.3:

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for all Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teleshield](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telebt;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

Two prototype versions have been built with different physical form factors.
We have working firmware, and a prototype of support in AltosUI.  Work is
also underway on an [Android](http://www.android.com) version of AltosUI.  

Prototype version 0.3 is working, and we hope to move TeleBT to production
soon.
