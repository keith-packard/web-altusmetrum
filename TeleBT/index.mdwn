# TeleBT

TeleBT provides the equivalent of a [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle), with
the addition of [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com) as an alternative to
USB for connection to the ground station computer. 

The RF filter components are set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz.

These are photos of the first production version, 1.0:

And here's what it looks like packaged with battery, attached to an Arrow 
3-element yagi, ready for use:

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for all Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teleshield](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telebt;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

Production version 1.0 is available to purchase!  TeleBT works
with both AltosUI version 1.2 and later, and a new
[Android](http://www.android.com) application 
called [AltosDroid](../AltosDroid).

We're pretty happy with TeleBT and have no plans to change it at this time.
