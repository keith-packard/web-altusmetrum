# TeleBT

TeleBT provides the equivalent of a [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle), with
the addition of [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com) as an alternative to
USB for connection to the ground station computer. 

The RF filter components are set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz.

These are photos of the first production version, 1.0:

And here's what it looks like packaged with battery, attached to an Arrow 
3-element yagi, ready for use:

For the latest TeleBT firmware and related software, please
visit the [AltOS](../AltOS) and [AltosDroid](../AltosDroid) pages on this site.

If you're using TeleBT with an [Arrow](http://www.arrowantennas.com/) yagi,
we now have a 3D-printable [mount](mount/) design available!

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for all Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teleshield](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telebt;a=summary).  

For those who don't have ready access to the gEDA suite, here are pdf snapshots
of the files for Production PCB version 1.0 in more easily readable form.

* [pcb artwork](v1.0/telebt.pcb.pdf)

## Future Plans ##

The inventory of version 1.0 boards was lost in the fire that destroyed 
Bdale's home in June of 2013.  Version 1.1 will be available for purchase 
we hope by the end of October 2013.

TeleBT works with both AltosUI version 1.2 and later, and a new
[Android](http://www.android.com) application 
called [AltosDroid](../AltosDroid).
