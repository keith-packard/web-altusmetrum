# TeleBT

TeleBT provides the equivalent of a [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle), with
the addition of [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com) as an alternative to
USB for connection to the ground station computer.

The RF filter components are set for use in the vicinity of 435 Mhz.

For the latest TeleBT firmware and related software, please
visit the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for all Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/teleshield](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telebt;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

Two prototype versions have been built with different physical form factors,
v0.2 could be put into production at any time.
