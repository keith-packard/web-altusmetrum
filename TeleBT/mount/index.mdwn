# TeleBT Mount

The most common way to use a TeleBT is to match it up with a short yagi and
suitable connector adapter.  For all but the most demanding high-altitude
flights, we like the 
[3-element Arrow II Hand Held Portable](http://www.arrowantennas.com/arrowii/440-3ii.html)
antenna, and a simple [SMA to BNC adapter](http://shop.gag.com/parts-and-accessories/sma-to-bnc-adapter.html)
that we sell.

The missing piece in this setup is some sort of bracket to keep the TeleBT
from flopping around on the antenna boom and loosening up the SMA 
connector.  Thanks to Robert Garbee, we're happy to share this excellent 
bracket design!
