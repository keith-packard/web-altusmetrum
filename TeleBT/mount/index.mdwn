# TeleBT Mount

The most common way to use a TeleBT is to match it up with a short yagi and
suitable connector adapter.  For all but the most demanding high-altitude
flights, we like the 
[3-element Arrow II Hand Held Portable](http://www.arrowantennas.com/arrowii/440-3ii.html)
antenna, and a simple [SMA to BNC adapter](http://shop.gag.com/parts-and-accessories/sma-to-bnc-adapter.html)
that we sell.

The missing piece in this setup is some sort of bracket to keep the TeleBT
from flopping around on the antenna boom and loosening up the SMA 
connector.  Thanks to Robert Garbee, we're happy to share this excellent 
bracket design!  Here's what it looks like, alone and in use:

## Availability ##

As with all of our products, this is a fully open design. If you have a 3D 
printer, please feel free to print one for yourself.  They are also available
for sale in 
[Bdale's Store](http://shop.gag.com/parts-and-accessories/telebt-bracket.html).

## Printing Hints ##

All of our 3D printing is done on [Lulzbot](https://www.lulzbot.com/) 
printers, and the brackets we sell are printed in ABS.

If you look closely at the STL file, you will notice that there's a slight
chamfer on one side of the bracket around the square hole for the antenna
boom.  You should print the bracket with this side "down".  The point of this
chamfer is to counteract the usual "spreading" of plastic on the first layer
of a print.  On a Lulzbot TAZ printer, this chamfer causes the resulting
printed part to have a nearly perfect corner, which means it's ready to use
right off the printer without any sanding or scraping to fit required!
