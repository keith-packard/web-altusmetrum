# EasyMega

This is a high-end recording dual-deploy altimeter for high power model 
rocketry.  The feature set is identical to [TeleMega](../TeleMega), but 
without the integrated GPS and telemetry link.  This makes EasyMega an
ideal choice for complex projects including sustainers on multi-stage 
projects where integrated radio functionality isn't needed.  4 of the 6
pyro events are configurable and can be based on time and various flight 
events and status, including angle from vertical.

For the latest EasyMega firmware and related ground station software, please
visit the [AltOS](../AltOS) page on this site.  EasyMega requires AltOS
version 1.4.2 or later.

Here are photos of the first production version:

## Artifacts ##

There is a single manual for EasyMega and most other Altus Metrum products,
which is available in [html](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html) and 
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.pdf) formats.

The hardware design current gEDA files are available from 
[git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the project 
[hw/easymega](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/easymega;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

Version 0.1 prototypes are built and seem to work.  After some flight testing,
we'll decide if and when this goes to production.
