# Altus Metrum Presentations

These are presentations we've made at various conferences.  Not everything
is linked in here yet...  Be warned, the OpenOffice presentation files tend 
to be HUGE, since we include lots of high-resolution photos!

  end of the talk, featuring Bdale's big 
  [Goblin](http://www.gag.com/rockets/projects/goblin10/) airframe and a 
  few, brave, [woot.com](http://woot.com) screaming flying monkey dolls!  Much
  later, the Woot gang put out a 
  [video update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_6sLheu3_U)
  celebrating the successful recovery of two of the monkeys...

## LCA 2009 ##

Bdale's second LCA presentation on rocketry, this time covering a broad range
of related activites and the application of open hardware and open source
philosophy in each.  At the time of this talk, [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum) v0.1
bare boards had just arrived, but nothing had been populated yet!
