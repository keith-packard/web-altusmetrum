# TeleTerra

This is a hand-held ground station for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).

## Motivation ##

While it is possible to use a partially (or fully!) loaded 
[TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) board as a USB to RF interface, we think 
it would be cool to have a nice hand-held ground station we can use in
full sunlight on the flight line.  If it can help locate the rocket and is
easy to carry during recovery operations, so much the better!

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Hand-held unit about the size of a calculator with 4 line 20 character LCD
* Antenna for the telemetry stream from [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/)
* Integrated GPS receiver core to allow display of current user position,
and relative position of GPS-equipped rockets
* Integrated rechargable battery
* USB interface for configuration and power 

### Developer View ###

* Single circuit board
	* equivalent of a [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) less the sensors
	* [Atmel ATtiny48](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card_v2.asp?PN=ATtiny48) used as an I/O expander
	* 4 line, 20 character transreflective text LCD display
	* "joystick" switch for user inputs
* LiPo battery
* Software Features (planned)
	* [AltOS](../AltOS) for the cc1111 and simple C for the AVR
* Tools Used
	* [gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/) for schematic capture and PCB layout
* Licenses
	* The hardware is licensed under the [TAPR](http://www.tapr.org) [Open Hardware License](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html)
