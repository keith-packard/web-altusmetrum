# TeleTerra

This is a hand-held ground station for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).

## Motivation ##

While it is possible to use a partially (or fully!) loaded 
[TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) board as a USB to RF interface, we think 
it would be cool to have a nice hand-held ground station we can use in
full sunlight on the flight line.  If it can help locate the rocket and is
easy to carry during recovery operations, so much the better!

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Hand-held until about the size of a calculator
* Antenna for the telemetry stream from [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/)
