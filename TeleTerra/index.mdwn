# TeleTerra

TeleTerra is a hand-held ground station for [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/).  

These are photos of our current, first cut prototype hardware:

## Motivation ##

While using a [TeleDongle](../TeleDongle/) board as a USB to RF interface to 
a notebook computer works splendidly, we think it would be cool to have a 
nice hand-held ground station we can use in full sunlight on the flight line.
If it can help locate the rocket and is
easy to carry during recovery operations, so much the better!

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Hand-held unit about the size of a calculator 
* 4 line by 20 character text LCD
* "joyswitch" for user input (up, down, left, right, push)
* Antenna connector for the telemetry stream from [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/)
* Integrated GPS receiver and antenna to allow display of current user 
  position, and relative position of GPS-equipped rockets
* Audio amplifier and speaker for voice status updates
* Integrated rechargable battery
* USB interface for configuration, power, and flight log extraction

### Developer View ###

* Single circuit board
	* equivalent of a [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum/) less the sensors
	* [Atmel ATtiny48](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card_v2.asp?PN=ATtiny48) used as an I/O expander
	* 4 line, 20 character transreflective text LCD display
	* multi-directional switch for user inputs
* 2Ah LiPo battery for all-day use
* Software Features (planned)
	* [AltOS](../AltOS) for the cc1111 and simple C for the AVR
* Tools Used
	* [gEDA](http://www.gpleda.org/) for schematic capture and PCB layout
* Licenses
	* The hardware is licensed under the [TAPR](http://www.tapr.org) [Open Hardware License](http://www.tapr.org/ohl.html)
	* The software is licensed [GPL version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

## Artifacts ##

Schematics and PCB artwork exist at

## Future Plans ##

As of late 2010, two prototypes built using the v0.1 circuit boards 
are assembled, and the hardware is mostly tested.  Software development
is underway, but we're not yet sure when or even if this design will 
enter production.
