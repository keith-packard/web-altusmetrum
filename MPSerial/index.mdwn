# MicroPeak Serial Interface (MPSerial) #

The MicroPeak Serial Interface board provides a way to capture flight
logs over a USB connection to a computer running Linux, Mac OS or
Windows.

Here's a picture of the prototype.

The final board will have an LED to help check alignment between the
MicroPeak LED and the MicroPeak Serial phototransistor.

## MicroPeak Data ##

 * Stored in on-chip 512B eeprom
 * Records raw barometer readings every 192ms
 * Enough storage for 48 seconds

No changes are needed to the MicroPeak hardware, but new firmware that
includes the data download feature is necessary to use the MicroPeak
Serial Interface.

## MicroPeak Interface ##

MicroPeak transmits the entire flight log via the LED just after
reporting the last flight altitude at power up. The data are
transmitted in regular serial format at 9600 baud.

The MicroPeak Serial Interface board contains a phototransistor,
op-amp and serial-to-USB interface chip.
