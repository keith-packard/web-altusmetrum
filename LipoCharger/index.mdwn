# LipoCharger

This is a simple but effective charger for LiPo batteries.  It has a higher
charge rate than the on-board charger on [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum), and
will be necessary for charging the batteries used with projects like
[TeleNano](../TeleNano) and [TeleMini](../TeleMini), which do not have 
on-board charging capability.

## Features ##

## Artifacts ##

The design files can be found on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the 
project [hw/lipocharger](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/lipocharger;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

We need to build and evaluate some prototypes, and review costing, before 
deciding whether this design will go into production.
