# LipoCharger

This is a simple but effective, dual-rate, standalone charger for Lithium
Polymer batteries.  It supports two different charge rates selectable with
a swtich, of approximately 100mA and 500mA.  The 500mA rate is good for 
batteries of 400 mAh and higher including the 900mAh cells sold with 
[TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum) starter kits, while the 100mA rate is more 
appropriate for the 110mAh cells often used with [TeleMini](../TeleMini).  A 
standalone charger is essential for use with TeleMini since it does not 
have on-board charging capability.

Production units are available from the 
[Garbee and Garbee](https://shop.gag.com) web store.
