Production units will be available from the
[Garbee and Garbee](http://auric.gag.com) web
store.

## Documentation ##

The MicroPeak manual is available in
[html](../AltOS/doc/micropeak.html) and
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/micropeak.pdf) formats.

## Hardware Features ##

 * Measure ground pressure and peak altitude pressure.
 * Blue LED blinks out maximum height in decimeters.
 * 18mm x 14mm. 1.9g including battery.
 * Power switch.

The CR1025 battery holder is mounted on the back side of the board, so there are no external wires or batteries to manage.

## Software features ##

 * Saves last flight data to non-volatile memory.
 * Reports previous flight on power-on.
 * Automatically shuts down on landing to preserve battery.

## Battery Holder ##

MicroPeak includes an integrated battery holder on the back side of
the circuit board.
