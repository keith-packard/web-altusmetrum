# Introducing MicroPeak by AltusMetrum #

Micropeak is a peak-recording barometric altimeter for precision model
rocketry altitude measurements.

Production units are available from the
[Garbee and Garbee](http://auric.gag.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=80) 
web store and [Apogee Components](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Electronics_Payloads/Altimeters/MicroPeak_Altimeter)

## Documentation ##

The MicroPeak manual is available in
[html](../AltOS/doc/micropeak.html) and
[pdf](../AltOS/doc/micropeak.pdf) formats.

## Software ##

The MicroPeak application runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It
communicates with the MicroPeak USB adapter to download and analyze
flight data. It's written in [Java](http://java.com) and offers the
same functionality and interface on all three platforms. It uses the
FTDI USB Serial drivers to communicate with the hardware. If you're
running Mac OS X or Windows, a compatible version of those drivers is
included with the software. You can also install a different from from
the [FTDI Driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/FTDrivers.htm) page.

### Latest version ###

 * [Windows](releases/1.2/MicroPeak-Windows-1-1-9-3.exe)
 * [Linux](releases/1.2/MicroPeak-Linux-1.1.9.3.tar.bz2)
 * [Mac OS X](releases/1.2/MicroPeak-Mac-1.1.9.3.dmg)

## Hardware Features ##

 * Measure ground pressure and peak altitude pressure.
 * Orange LED blinks out maximum height in decimeters.
 * 18mm x 14mm. 1.9g including battery.
 * Power switch.

The CR1025 battery holder is mounted on the back side of the board, so there are no external wires or batteries to manage.

## Software features ##

 * Saves last flight data to non-volatile memory.
 * Reports previous flight on power-on.
 * Automatically shuts down on landing to preserve battery.

## Battery Holder ##

MicroPeak includes an integrated battery holder on the back side of
the circuit board.
