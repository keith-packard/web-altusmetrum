<ul>
<li>
<p>Add Booster mode for all dual-deploy altimeters. Select
"Separation &amp; Apogee" mode in AltosUI to fire the 'main'
channel at first motor burnout and the 'apogee' channel at
apogee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve reliability of stm32l firmware under heavy
load. This was found using Monitor Idle on TeleMega with all
flash slots full of data which would occasionally lock up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix orientation label in AltosUI for devices with
radios. This makes the orientation say 'Antenna up' and
'Antenna Down' for TeleMetrum and TeleMega again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix log data for pyro channels which were inhibited (often
because of a tilt limit). They used to report 'fired' as
soon as they were inhibited, which was misleading. Now they
never report as having been fired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow Igniter Test to fire each igniter more than once.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improve performance of Monitor Idle mode by sending less data for each
update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve Mac OS X install scripts so that they work on
Catalina. This involves sending the user to get Java from
the AdoptOpenJDK project which provides a version that works
with Java applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make larger dialogs scrollable for use on smaller screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix troubles re-flashing EasyMega boards running older
firmware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add TeleMetrum v3.0 firmware to the Windows
AltosUI packages.</p>
</li>
