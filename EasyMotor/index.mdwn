# EasyMotor

This board is designed for in-flight characterization of research rocket
motors.  It records chamber pressure and acceleration to an on-board flash
memory chip, the contents of which can be downloaded after flight over USB.  
It can also be attached to a [TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum) or
[TeleMega](../TeleMega) using the companion interface to allow a subset of
the data to be included in radio telemetry during the flight.

There is no EasyMotor firmware yet, but it will be part of the 
[AltOS](../AltOS) suite eventually.

Prototypes of v1 are underway.  This design is not yet for sale.
