# EasyMotor

This board is designed for in-flight characterization of research rocket
motors.  It records chamber pressure and acceleration to an on-board flash
memory chip, the contents of which can be downloaded after flight over USB.  

EasyMotor firmware is under development within the [AltOS](../AltOS) suite.

Prototypes of v1 were built and evaluated, prototypes of v2 are built, 
with development of firmware and evaluation underay.  This design is not 
yet for sale, but we hope to have it on the market by the end of 2020.

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Data logger storing motor chamber pressure and acceleration
* supports inexpensive 5V analog output pressure sensors
* 3-axis 200-g accelerometer
* On-board non-volatile memory for flight data storage
* USB for configuration, and data recovery
* Designed for use with a battery from 9-12V
* 1.5 x 0.8 inch board

## Artifacts ##

This board was designed using lepton-eda and pcb-rnd.
