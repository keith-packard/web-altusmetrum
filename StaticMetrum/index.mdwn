# StaticMetrum

This is a test stand Bdale built for testing research motors.

## Motivation ##

There is a lot of fun and education possible using only commercially 
manufactured hobby rocket motors.  But making every part of the rocket
including the motor has some allure... and being geeky sorts, getting 
good data on our experiments seems pretty important.
