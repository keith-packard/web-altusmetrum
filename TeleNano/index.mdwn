# TeleNano

This is an extremely small, baro-only recording altimeter for 
high power model rocketry with integrated telemetry link.  

## Motivation ##

We hope with TeleNano to deliver an interesting "introductory" product 
in a different price category than our flagship products like 
[TeleMetrum](../TeleMetrum).  The combination of a baro altimeter and
radio direction finding ability in a super-tiny package seems like it
might be fun even for [Estes](http://www.estesrockets.com/) sized rockets!

## Features ##

### User View ###

* Recording altimeter for model rocketry
* 70cm ham-band transceiver for telemetry downlink
* Barometric pressure sensor good to 45k feet MSL
* Designed to use a single LiPo rechargeable battery
* 1.0 x 0.5 inch board designed to fit inside 18mm airframe coupler tube

### Developer View ###

## Artifacts ##

The design files can be found on [git.gag.com](http://git.gag.com) in the 
project [hw/telenano](http://git.gag.com/?p=hw/telenano;a=summary).  

## Future Plans ##

Initial hardware prototypes are assembled and working.  Work proceeds on 
suitable firmware.  We do not have a target production date or retail 
price for TeleNano yet.
